It was reported this week that Pokémon GO's monthly revenue had dropped to $34.7m in April, down from $39.7m in the month previous, which makes it the lowest monthly revenue since February 2018, according to Mobilegamer.biz, who made their report based on statistics from [AppMagic](https://appmagic.rocks/product-deck). On March 30th, Niantic, the company behind Pokémon GO, went ahead with their plans to increase the price of Remote Raid passes and limit their use to five per day, despite widespread criticism from the Pokémon GO community due to their accessibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and allowing people who couldn’t normally engage in Pokémon GO, such as those with disabilities or other health conditions, the opportunity to do so.

On May 4th, Niantic responded to a request from Eurogamer which suggests this information is incorrect. "We generally don't comment on third-party estimates of our revenue as they are often incorrect, which is the case here," a spokesperson for Niantic told Eurogamer after they contacted the company. The spokesperson went on to say, "This year's changes have already increased in-person Raiding and we're excited to introduce exciting new features over the coming months," suggesting that they are sticking to their announced plans.

Back in August 2021, [the company had suggested](https://nianticlabs.com/news/pgo-exploration-bonus-response?hl=en) that they were listening to feedback from fans and reaching out to community leaders to get involved with dialogue on topics like interaction distance for in-game gyms. While the conditions are a little different compared to then, their radio silence in response to the #HearUsNiantic campaign and recent events is a departure from their attitude almost two years ago.
