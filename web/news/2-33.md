We are saddened to report that Rachael Lillis, the actress who provided the voices of Misty, Jessie, Jigglypuff, and many other characters in the English adaptation of the Pokémon anime, has passed away. She died on August 10th, 2024, after a battle with cancer. She was 55 years old. We are devastated by this news, but grateful for her massive contribution to the Pokémon anime, where her memory will continue to live on.
We have postponed next week's planned issue and will be putting together a special tribute issue in memory of Rachael instead. We welcome our readers to contribute some words for it, if they feel comfortable doing so, [by sending their messages of tribute via email](mailto:johtotimesmail@gmail.com) to us by **Sunday, August 18th, 2024, at 18:00 UTC**. In order to include as many reader tributes as possible, we request that you please limit this to a short paragraph, around 100 words. We will attempt to publish as many as we can in next week’s issue, but apologise if we can’t include everyone.
