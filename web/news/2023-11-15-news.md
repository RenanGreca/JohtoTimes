The Pokémon Company have announced that the long-awaited _Pokémon Horizons: The Series_ dub is coming to BBC iPlayer for residents in the United Kingdom this December. The series was released in Japan in April this year, but until recently it was unknown when the localised version would arrive for English-speaking audiences. No specific date has been announced, but the iPlayer website currently displays the date of the first episode (“The Pendant That Starts It All: Part One”) as December 1st 2023, which could be a placeholder.  

Please note: You will need to have a TV licence in order to use BBC iPlayer.
