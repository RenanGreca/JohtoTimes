Niantic has revealed a new event for Pokémon GO called "Catching Wonders", which takes place between 10:00 on May 14th and 20:00 on May 19th, local time. During this event, you will receive ten times the usual amount of experience for your first catch and first PokéStop or Gym spin of the day. You will also receive five times the amount of Stardust for your first catch of the day. 

The most exciting part of this event is the Masterwork Research, which is designed to be completed over a long period of time.
