Last week, the Pokémon x Van Gogh Museum collaboration began showcasing several Pokémon events, with Pokémon merchandise available for sale, including a Pokémon TCG promo card, “Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat”. Regretfully, footage from the museum appeared online showing customers pushing and shoving each other and grabbing merchandise in a desperate attempt to purchase it. It’s alleged that the people doing this are scalpers who are selling the products online at massively inflated prices, evidenced by sold listings seen on eBay. Products on the Pokémon Center website, where the promo card was available to anyone who made a purchase of them, were sold out instantly, leaving many fans highly disappointed.

Pokémon preservationist toloveL, who we have [featured previously](https://johto.substack.com/p/interview-pokemon-center-ny-historical-website) on Johto Times and works at an art gallery for her day job, [speaks passionately about the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEDBj6z0zdw), describing how dangerous it is to behave this way around priceless art being displayed. The Pokémon Company themselves issued a statement on Friday to apologise for the situation, and are “actively working on ways to provide more "Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat" promo cards for fans shopping at Pokémon Center in the future”. There was no mention of whether more of the previously sold products would be made available in the future.
