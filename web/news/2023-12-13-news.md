#### Feature: Interview with The Pokemon Factory

The Pokémon Factory (PF) was founded on December 27th 1998 and was known for creating fake Pokémon in modified screenshots from Pokémon games, namely Pokémon Red and Blue. It was originally called Mewthree and Frogglet's Pokémon Factory, with Frogglet later leaving the site and his brother Aspenth replacing him. Over the years that followed, many different staff members and artists would join the team to contribute to the ever-growing fake Pokémon collection. One of these individuals was Bonzai, who has kindly offered to speak to us on behalf of The Pokémon Factory.
