The top 300 entries for the Pokémon TCG Illustration Contest 2024 were announced this week, featuring artwork of Pokémon with the theme “Magical Pokémon Moments”. The contest was announced in October last year and closed on January 31st this year. Over ten thousand entries were submitted and only two artists will win, with their artwork being used on an official Pokémon promo card! But shortly after the finalists were announced, the contest came under fire by users who noticed that some of the participants appeared to have used generative AI to create their entries. Understandably, this has upset people who didn’t make the final cut and clouds the integrity of the contest.
AI generated artwork has seen a huge rise in popularity over the past couple of years, and, as the technology continues to improve, it becomes more difficult to detect what is and isn’t real. It scrapes existing artwork and impacts the livelihood and good will of other artists who take the time to create their works from scratch. We hope that these claims are investigated thoroughly by The Pokémon Company and the judges, and if proven to be accurate, they will take appropriate action to disqualify those responsible. To the artists who worked hard to create incredible pieces of Pokémon art, congratulations on being chosen, and good luck!
