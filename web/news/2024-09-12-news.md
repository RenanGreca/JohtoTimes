A new PokéLid featuring Pikachu and a Game Boy console, was unveiled yesterday at the Nintendo Museum by Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa, and Takato Utsunomiya, COO of The Pokémon Company, ahead of its opening on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2024. This Pokémon-themed Utility Hole Cover is located inside the museum itself, and is one of many designs across Japan, currently the third in the city of Uji, Kyoto Prefecture.

PokéLids are part of the Pokémon Local Acts campaign, which assign Pokémon as ambassadors to specific areas of Japan, to aid their local economies, such as parks. At the time of writing, there are over 350 PokéLids across Japan, with some made into special PokéStops for Pokémon GO. Merchandise featuring the PokéLids are also available, which include badges, keychains, and mugs.
