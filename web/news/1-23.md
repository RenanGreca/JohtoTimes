Pokémon Sleep, the long-awaited sleep tracking app, is almost ready for release. The game recently had an open beta for Android users between July 9th - 13th in Australia, Argentina, Canada & New Zealand, and opened up to further countries as the week progressed. Members of the gaming press were invited to a preview event by The Pokémon Company International. Joe Merrick from Serebii.net, one of the largest Pokémon fan sites online, was among those invited to the event, and you can read his initial thoughts on Pokémon Sleep [here](https://www.serebii.net/pokemonsleep/preview/).
At the time of writing, we don’t have a specific release date for Pokémon Sleep, but Serebii made a tweet to suggest it would be released in late July 2023. The game is currently available for pre-registration on Android, so we can rest easy knowing that the game will be released very soon!

Back in September 2022, The Pokémon Company announced the Pokémon Music Collective, where musicians would release music using sounds from Pokémon to create new music in a variety of different styles. On July 11th 2023, the second song 'One and Only' by South Korean boy band ENHYPEN (엔하이픈) was released. You can check out the music video here!
