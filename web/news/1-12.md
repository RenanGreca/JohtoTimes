We were saddened to hear the news regarding James Carter Cathcart, a voice actor who is best known for voicing the character of Gary Oak in the original Pokémon anime, is retiring due to throat cancer. He played Gary from the very first episode of the Pokémon anime and went on to voice several other characters, most notably Professor Oak, as well as Team Rocket’s James and Meowth since Pokémon USA took over the dubbing rights. On behalf of the Johto Times, we send our best wishes to Mr. Cathcart and his family during this challenging time.
