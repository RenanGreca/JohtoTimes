The latest Nintendo Direct presentation aired yesterday, revealing a trailer for Detective Pikachu Returns, a sequel to the February 2016 game on Nintendo 3DS. The game was first announced back in May 2019 shortly after the film adaptation was released, and now finally, four and a half years after it was first announced, it will release on October 6th 2023 for Nintendo Switch. A description for the game is available on Nintendo’s official website, where the game can now be pre-ordered:

Solve mysteries with the personality-packed Detective Pikachu!

Unravel a series of mysteries across Ryme City with a tough-talking, coffee-loving Pikachu who calls himself a great detective. This Pikachu may have a self-assured attitude and talk like a middle-aged man, but he somehow manages to keep his lovable charm. Together with his partner Tim Goodman, this great detective duo cracks several cases with the help of the many Pokémon and people who live in Ryme City.

Investigate Ryme City, where Pokémon and people live side by side

Search for clues in Ryme City, where Pokémon and humans coexist in harmony. With the help of many other Pokémon, Tim and his talkative Pikachu partner work together to solve a series of mysterious incidents in this cinematic adventure game.
