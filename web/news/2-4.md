Sources from the Van Gogh Museum, who spoke with Dutch news website Het Parool, confirmed recently that four employees were suspended due to misconduct, in connection with the Pokémon exhibition which took place last year. This included security guards and public service employees, with one employee allegedly stealing a box of Pokémon cards. It would appear that it wasn’t just attendees and scalpers who were to blame for the poor handling of the event.

The Pokémon Company released a statement on Thursday January 25th, 2024, regarding inquiries into other companies' games. TPC have “received many inquiries regarding another company’s game released in January 2024” and have “not granted any permission for the use of Pokémon intellectual property or assets in that game”.
While not specifically mentioned in the statement, the video game Palworld released this week with over seven million sales in five days. The action-adventure survival game, made by Japanese developer Pocket Pair, has been dominating the news due to its similarities to Pokémon, with accusations of stealing assets and the use of AI. TPC’s statement goes on to say “we intend to investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon”.
