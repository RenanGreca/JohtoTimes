The Toyota Miraidon Project is a collaboration between the Toyota Engineering Society and The Pokémon Company, which was officially revealed today on March 14th, 2024. The team at Toyota have built a life-sized moving and mechanical Miraidon, which will be on display this weekend at the Tokyo Midtown Hibiya, between March 15th - 17th 2024. A video for the project can be found on the official [Pokémon YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF8PLRH_SGc) and more videos of the Miraidon in action can be found on the [plus-digital YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@plus-digital/featured).

The society was founded in 1947 as an informal out-of-hours organisation for Toyota employees to increase their knowledge and enthusiasm for future mobility technologies. [In 2015, they even built a hoverboard!](https://designmadeinjapan.com/magazine/lexus-hoverboard-back-to-the-future/)

The event will be free of charge, and anyone under 65kgs can claim a numbered ticket at the event to ride the Miraidon (tickets are limited). Full details of the event can be found on the source link below.
