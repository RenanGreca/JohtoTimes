#### Feature: Interview with The Cave of Dragonflies

The Cave of Dragonflies (TCoD) is a Pokémon fan website with a large variety of useful information, theories, opinions, and original content. The website was founded on November 2nd 2002 as “Butterfree's Pokémon Site”. It is managed and maintained solely by its webmistress Dragonfree, and has been active and online since its creation.

Disclaimer: I should point out that at the time of writing, Dragonfree also proofreads content for Johto Times, and we first became friends in the mid 2000s when my own Pokémon fan website was an affiliate of TCoD.
