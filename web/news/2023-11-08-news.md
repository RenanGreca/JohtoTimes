The Pokémon Company have announced that the second part of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s DLC will be released on December 14th 2023 for Nintendo Switch. _The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero: The Indigo Disk_ opens up a new area called Blueberry Academy, with a heavy focus on battling. While The Pokémon Company have been tight-lipped about the DLC, we do know that all starter Pokémon from previous mainline games will be making a return, and new Paradox Pokémon such as Iron Crown and Raging Bolt and a new legendary Pokémon called Terapagos will make their debut. We expect more information will be released prior to launch.

Furthermore, physical editions of Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet with _The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero_ included are now available (a patch will be required to unlock _The Indigo Disk_ once it launches next month).

A long-rumoured Pokémon trading card from the original base set from Wizards of the Coast has been confirmed to be authentic by CGC Cards. Prerelease Raichu was a card with a PRERELEASE stamp, intended for the Clefable card in the set. The stamp was printed across eleven base set Raichu cards, which were cut from a sheet and distributed to some Wizards of the Coast employees. For two decades the existence of Prerelease Raichu has been nothing more than a rumour, but thanks to CGC’s authentication process, two Prerelease Raichu cards have been confirmed genuine.

Their authenticity was determined by graders, who cross-referenced both Prerelease Raichu cards with a Prerelease Clefable card using specialised lighting at 42x magnification. Forensic analysts examined the chemical makeup of the foil stamps compared to two genuine Prerelease Clefable cards, and both Raichu cards were sourced back to Wizards of the Coast employees who confirmed the authenticity of the story.
