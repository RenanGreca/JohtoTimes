Last week the Pokémon Trading Card Game Classic, a premium product that was announced back in February, was made available for pre-order on the Pokémon Center website. Despite a $399.99/£399.99 price tag, the product sold out immediately. The set will contain three decks of sixty cards, featuring classics from the early era of the franchise. The set will also include six additional cards: Lugia EX, Ho-Oh EX, Suicune EX, Sun Seed, Scorching Charcoal, and Drops in the Ocean. One final card was also announced for the set, featuring Mr. Mime. It was originally part of the Vending Machine series and never released outside of Japan.

While the product remains out of stock at the time of writing, we hope that it will be readily available on release in mid-November 2023.

[Last week, we shared news](https://johto.substack.com/p/vol1-33) on a collaboration between Pokémon and the Van Gogh Museum, which began today, and runs until Sunday, January 7th 2024. Thanks to Serebii.net, we now know that the museum will showcase several Pokémon events. These will include artwork inspired by Vincent van Gogh with a Pokémon twist, video activities, online learning material to teach children about the connections between Van Gogh and Japan, and a Pokémon Adventure activity where visitors can learn about the inspiration of the artworks. A special promo card featuring Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat will be available to attendees, with themed merchandise which can be purchased. Merchandise will also be available on the Pokémon Center UK website!
