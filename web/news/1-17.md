Pokémon HOME has finally received its 3.0.0 update, adding connectivity to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The Pokémon Company announced on Twitter this week that maintenance would begin on Monday May 29th 2023 in preparation for the long anticipated version. This comes after a retracted statement last week, where the company was forced to correct the record and state that no release date had been decided at the time. All 1010 Pokémon and their forms can now be stored in the app.
