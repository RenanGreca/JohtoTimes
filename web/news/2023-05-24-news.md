Niantic have introduced Shadow Raids to Pokémon GO, alongside a new event called Rising Shadows, which runs between May 22nd at 10:00 local time to May 28th at 20:00 local time. It introduces the Master Ball into the game, an item that is capable of capturing any Pokémon without fail! Unlike regular raids, Remote Raid passes will not work for Shadow Raids, which fans of Pokémon GO, especially those that have been part of the #HearUsNiantic movement, will be deeply disappointed to hear. Full details on Shadow Raids can be found [here](https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/shadow-raids/).
