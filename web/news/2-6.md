An update for fans of the Pokémon animated series: Pokémon Journeys and Pokémon Master Journeys will be leaving Netflix on March 4th, 2024. This is confirmed on the Netflix streaming service, showing that both shows are marked as "Last day to watch on Netflix". Do you think there’s still enough time to binge watch everything?

Last year, the Van Gogh museum in the Netherlands collaborated with Pokémon to mark the 50th anniversary of the museum. They offered the Grey Felt Hat promo card for attendees, alongside many other Van Gogh Pokémon-themed products. The event was ruined by scalpers and staff who decided that their financial gains were more important than the genuine fans who wanted to make the most of the event.

The Pokémon Company will now be distributing the popular Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat promo card to hobby stores and larger chains in the Netherlands. Initially, hobby stores were to receive one hundred cards each, but this has since been reduced to ten. From February 10th, 2024, customers at Bruna, Game Mania, Intertoys, Media Markt, Primera, Top1Toys, and Smyths Toy Superstores will have a limited number of cards to give to customers who spend €29.99 or more to receive one.

Due to how these distributions have taken place previously, I truly hope that these cards will finally find their way into the hands of genuine fans and collectors this time around.
