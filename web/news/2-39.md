The winners of the Pokémon TCG Illustration Contest 2024 have been officially announced. The Grand Prize was awarded to Kazuki Minami from Japan, with his very charming Pikachu card, inspired by his pet dog. One judge praised the "heartwarming, goofy, exquisite cuteness of the yawning Pikachu". Another said "the artist has succeeded in creating a relatable and evocative setting" and "placing Pikachu at the center of the frame emphasizes the charm of the moment, while the subtle stylization adds originality without straying from authenticity".
Best Standard Card Illustration was awarded to Acorviart from Japan, with a calm-looking Feraligatr enjoying a morning swim. Best ex Card Illustration was awarded to an artist called Anderson from the USA, with a Toxtricity that looks like it's jumping right out of the card frame! 
The Johto Times would like to offer a huge congratulations to the winners, and to everyone who took part in the contest. Be sure to check out the link to the source below for all the artists’ and judges’ comments!

The Galarian Expedition event has been announced in Pokémon GO, which starts on October 4th, 2024, at 10:00am and goes on until October 11th, 2024 at 8:00pm local time. It introduces some Shiny Pokémon that have so far been unobtainable by official means into Pokémon GO, and the Pokémon series, for the very first time! If you’re a fan of raids, Shiny Zamazenta has a chance to appear, and for those who use their Daily Adventure Incense, there’s now a chance to encounter Shiny Galarian Articuno, Shiny Galarian Zapdos, and Shiny Galarian Moltres! There's also a purchasable Masterwork Research for a Master Ball, which will be useful if you encounter one of the Galarian legendary birds!
Quite a few other wild encounters during the event can also result in a Shiny variant, including Nidoran (male and female), Aron, and Shinx. A full list of available Pokémon, including information on collection challenges, research rewards, and other information, can be found on the Pokémon GO website, linked in the source below.
