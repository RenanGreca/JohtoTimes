I’m sad to report that Rachael Lillis, the original English dubbing artist for Misty and Jessie, is currently battling breast cancer. She has been receiving support at a nursing home in Los Angeles since late January, and the cancer has spread to her spine, causing her difficulty to walk. Her sister is currently organising a fundraiser for a caregiver, so she can receive support from home. Due to the generosity of fans, [the fundraiser](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-my-sister-rachael-with-medical-needs) has already reached over $44,000 at the time of writing, way above its initial $20,000 target.
On behalf of the Johto Times team, we wish Rachael well in her recovery.

Since September 2023, a song and art collaboration project between Pokémon and Hatsune Miku called Project Voltage has released a number of original songs. It has now been confirmed that all twenty-one tracks will be available on a new album, releasing in Japan on November 13th, 2024. It will have two discs, and will be sold for ¥7,700. It’s great to see collaborative projects like these, and hopefully we will see even more of them in the future!

Popular retailer GameStop will be selling graded Pokémon cards from next week in select stores in the United States. This is according to Pokémon TCG fan site [PokéBeach](https://www.pokebeach.com/2024/05/major-gamestop-to-begin-buying-and-selling-graded-pokemon-cards-next-week-selling-pokemon-singles-in-stores), which goes on to confirm that GameStop will initially accept cards from PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) between grades 8-10, with a value of less than $500. The company will also sell $1 holo cards and reverse holos. It will be interesting to see the reception of this new business venture from GameStop.
