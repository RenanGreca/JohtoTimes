Sticking with TCG news, a special three-part documentary was announced earlier this week, which features three different stories from the Pokémon TCG fandom and can be watched on the [Pokémon TCG website](https://tcg.pokemon.com/en-us/how-do-you-play/), and each episode released between June 13th - 15th 2023. The stories feature a teacher who uses the TCG to bond with her students, a fan who turned his childhood passion into a profession, and a family who supported their son's dream to take part in the Pokémon World Championships.
