The Van Gogh Museum issued a statement last Friday to update fans attending the Pokémon collaboration event. The statement explains that they have pulled the Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat promo card from the event due to the appalling behaviour by some attendees, [which we reported on a couple of weeks ago](https://johto.substack.com/p/vol1-35). The Pokémon x Van Gogh event will continue to be held at the museum in Amsterdam until January 4th, 2024, allowing visitors to continue to enjoy the collection of paintings and the museum. For anyone who missed out on the special promo card due to these events, they are available again from Pokémon Center UK, US and Canada (please check availability). Participating retailers in the Netherlands will also receive the card early next year.
