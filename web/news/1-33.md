The highly anticipated Pokémon TCG subset: Scarlet & Violet—151, launches tomorrow! As we previously reported, the set will include the original 151 Pokémon and contains special EX cards, illustration rares, supporter cards and full-art etched cards. Several products will launch on release, such as an Elite Trainer Box featuring Snorlax, Booster Bundles containing six booster packs, a Binder Collection, and a Poster Collection containing promo cards of all three Kanto partner Pokémon. More products, such as the Zapdos EX and Alakazam EX Collection boxes, and mini tins, will be available in the weeks ahead.

On a personal note, I am very excited to pick up this set for myself, and it’s the first new set I have actively collected since Neo Destiny in 2002!

The Pokémon Company has announced a collaboration with the Van Gogh Museum that will take place from September 28th 2023. While no further details have been revealed at the time of writing, there’s a possibility we could see some promo trading cards come out of this collaboration, similar to how, in 2018, The Pokémon Company collaborated with the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum’s Edvard Munch exhibition and released five promo cards based on his famous work _The Scream_.
