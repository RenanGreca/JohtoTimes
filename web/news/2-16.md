Niantic have announced their Rediscover GO campaign, which will include quality of life updates to the app. These include improvements to player avatar creation, changes to the game's visuals, and a new GO Snapshot feature. Kanto Pokémon will also be a focus during an event on April 22nd. Some of these features have already been trialled in certain parts of the world already, such as the United Kingdom.

I have seen the visual changes first hand for several weeks, and I like them. It’ll be great to see them fully rolled out across the world. Full details can be found on the Pokémon GO website on the source link below.

In Japan, the practice is banned, and the man could face up to five years in prison and/or a fine of up to 5 million yen! According to NHK News, the man allegedly took custom orders for rare Pokémon, and the data was sold for up to 13,000 yen through an online marketplace that sells video game assets and items.

Regretfully, Nintendo have now shut down online play for all 3DS and Wii U titles as of April 8th, 2024. However, Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter continue to be functional at the time of writing. I hope you made plenty of great memories playing Pokémon on these consoles!
