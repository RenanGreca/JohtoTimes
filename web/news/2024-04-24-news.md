The Pokémon Card Lounge, a facility dedicated to the Pokémon Trading Card Game, will open its doors today, April 25th, 2024, at the Shibuya Tsutaya, a multi-storey entertainment hub located in Shibuya City, Tokyo.

Players will be welcome to play the Pokémon TCG at one of their many tables and in private rooms at a cost. If you're feeling hungry the lounge offers drinks and snacks, which are available for free after paying an entry fee. There's also a range of exclusive merchandise such as shirts, bags, journals, and more!

It sounds like a fun, safe way for people to enjoy the Pokémon TCG together. If you’re heading over there, be sure to let us know what you think!
