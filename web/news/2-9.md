The Pokémon Company have announced Pokémon Legends: Z-A, coming to Nintendo Switch, in a trailer as part of their latest Pokémon Presents live stream. Information is in short supply at this early stage, but it has been confirmed that the game takes place entirely within Lumiose City, where an urban redevelopment plan is underway to shape the city into a place that belongs to both people and Pokémon. At the end of the trailer, we see the Mega Evolution symbol, implying that the ability to Mega Evolve will be present in this next Legends title. While the trailer didn't contain any gameplay footage, it is confirmed to release worldwide in 2025.

Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket has been announced for iOS and Android, releasing in 2024. The game allows you to open booster packs and collect cards, including special "immersive cards" that allow players to deep dive into the illustration of the card and explore it. Some cards have nostalgic illustrations, with some cards exclusive to the app. Players can also trade cards and take part in quick battles with other players using streamlined rules based on the classic Pokémon TCG battle system. Two booster packs can be opened each day at no cost.

The Pokémon Company have added Pokémon Ruby & Sapphire and Pokémon FireRed & LeafGreen's soundtracks to the Pokémon Sound Library, which began last year with Pokémon Red & Green and Pokémon Diamond & Pearl. This allows fans in Japan and the rest of Asia to download the music provided it's not used for profit. [Soundtracks have also been added to the official Pokémon YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PokemonCoJp/videos).
