Pokémon Sleep began its rollout across the world this week for iOS and Android devices, launching in Australia, Canada, Latin America and New Zealand, with further countries following suit as the days went on. The Pokémon GO Plus + has also been released at retail, a device that can be paired with Pokémon Sleep to help you track each siesta. When paired with Pokémon GO, it will automatically throw different kinds of Poké Balls to catch Pokémon. More information on Pokémon Sleep and Pokémon GO Plus + can be found in the source links below.

Will you be taking part?*



Speaking of Pokémon GO, the July 2023 Community Day event has been announced, with Poliwag as the star of the show! On Sunday July 30th, 2023 between 14:00 and 17:00 local time, an increase in this adorable tadpole Pokémon will be found within the game, with a greater chance of being shiny! Evolving Poliwhirl during the event or up to five hours afterward, will get you a Poliwrath that knows Counter, or a Politoed with Ice Beam. A Special Research story, Event Bonuses, Bonus Raid Battles, Stickers and more will be available during the day. Be sure to check the source link below for more information.

Back in issue 18 of the Johto Times, we interviewed Slix from Poliwager, a great fan website that has Poliwag as its mascot, which you should all check out. I hope that he and his community are looking forward to this upcoming event!
