The FBI have announced that two men have been charged with a fraudulent scheme to defraud buyers and marketplaces to purchase sports and Pokémon trading cards at inflated and false prices. They amassed over $2 million in fraudulent and attempted sales from the year 2022 until around May 2024. The pair are alleged to have made fake slabs and attempted to sell the cards for more than they are worth. If convicted, both men face up to twenty years in prison.
PSA issued a statement via Twitter to confirm that their Brand Protection team worked with the FBI to build a case to charge the two men, stating that protecting collectors from fraud is a top priority and an important step forward for the hobby.
