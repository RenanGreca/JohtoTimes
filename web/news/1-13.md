One interesting piece of news I saw on Twitter this week was that a Pokémon card shop in Japan will restrict the sale of the latest TCG sets, Snow Hazard and Clay Burst, to adults and children over junior high school age. This decision has been made in an effort to combat adult resellers and ensure that the target audience has the opportunity to obtain them. Children who meet the criteria set out by Hareruya 2, the trading card store in question, will be able to purchase up to ten packs per day, with products over six months old made available to everyone. Hareruya 2 opened in 2021, and claimed to be the world's largest TCG store, consisting of six floors with one of the world's largest inventories and expert services.

[I wrote an opinion piece back in March](https://johto.substack.com/p/the-state-of-the-pokemon-tcg), suggesting that people ‘spare a thought’ for the younger fans who are missing out on purchasing the cards, so I am personally delighted to see a store take such a decision.
