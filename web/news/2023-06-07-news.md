The Pokémon Company recently updated its website to share the latest figures on the sale of its products. As of March 2023, the company has shipped over 52.9 billion Pokémon cards in 89 different countries and regions. The total shipment of all Pokémon-related software now exceeds 480 million units globally. It also confirmed that Pokémon animated TV shows have aired in 192 countries and regions.
