A brand-new Pokémon was revealed by The Pokémon Company on Tuesday. Poltchageist, a Grass/Ghost type Pokémon, bears a resemblance to the Pokémon Sinistea, but is a completely new Pokémon. Its new ability, Hospitality, restores a small amount of its ally's HP when it enters battle. Poltchageist will be introduced in the DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet.
