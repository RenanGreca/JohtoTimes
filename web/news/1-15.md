Nintendo shared their Financial Results on May 9th, which included a sales update for Pokémon software on Nintendo Switch. Pokémon Scarlet & Violet have now sold a combined 22.1 million units worldwide, while Legends Arceus and Pokémon Sword & Shield sold 14.8 million units and 25.8 million units respectively. Interestingly, Scarlet and Violet only requires a further 1.6 million sales to overtake Pokémon Gold and Silver, and will make it the third best-selling titles in the series.

It was sad news for Pokémon GO players this week as Silph Road announced it was closing its doors after seven years. Silph Road was a thriving community that focused on discoveries and analysis related to Pokémon GO, with a significant number of fans. It was sponsored by Niantic for 12 months, as the community struggled with operating costs. Silph Road’s official Reddit account made the announcement on May 12th, and explained the reasons behind the closure:
“Niantic's sponsorship of the Silph Road has concluded. After considering the mounting financial constraints facing our team, along with the momentum and landscape of the game in 2023, our team has come to the bittersweet conclusion that it is time to close what has been an incredibly rewarding and memorable chapter of our lives.”
Silph Road’s community on Reddit will remain, but all social channels tools and resources will wind down up until August 1st 2023.
