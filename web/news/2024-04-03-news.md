On April 8th, 2024, at 16:00 PDT, online services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software will cease operation permanently. For Pokémon fans, it marks the end of an era, as games such as Pokémon X & Y, Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire, Sun & Moon, and Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon will no longer allow players to engage in online battling, trading, or any other services that require an internet connection. Online play for Pokkén Tournament on Wii U will also be impacted by this.

As we mentioned last week, this won’t immediately affect the use of Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter; however, Nintendo have stated that support for these “may also end at some point in the future” after this date. Full details can be found in the source link below.

Pokémon got behind the April Fools' Day shenanigans at the start of this month, with a Pokémon Sleep World Champions Tournament video for Pokémon Sleep. The nearly four minute trailer showed an arena packed with fans as contestants attempt various sleep styles and attempt to become Pokémon Sleep Champions. The humorous video serves as an advertisement for the game, but it was great fun to watch. A link to it can be found in the source below.  

Niantic also got on board with their own event titled “An Excellent Opportunity”, where Nice and Great throws counted as Excellent throws for the day.
