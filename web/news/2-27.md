King Charles III made a reference to Pokémon this week in a speech during a state banquet, welcoming the Emperor and Empress of Japan in the United Kingdom. In his speech, his Royal Highness referenced the time he and Emperor Naruhito spent time fishing when they were younger, and went on to say “The Pokémon phrase ‘gotta catch ’em all’ may resonate with my grandchildren, but for me it is, perhaps, aspirational”.
