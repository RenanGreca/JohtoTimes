For anyone planning to visit the Pokémon Store in Tokyo Station, you will have to wait until July 10th, 2024, when it reopens in larger premises at First Avenue Tokyo Station, on the first floor. When it reopens, the store will have a new look, featuring the Paldean starters and a Station Pikachu mascot. The store will sell a range of merchandise, such as an adorable Station Master Pikachu plush toy, and offer exclusive items such as a Station Master Pikachu shopping bag and cookies.

Pokémon GO celebrates its eighth anniversary next week, but the in-game celebrations will be starting early! From June 28th to July 3rd, Party Hat Grimer and Muk will be introduced to the game, along with other party hat-wearing Pokémon from previous events. Paid content in the form of a Masterwork Research story, Whispers in the Woods, will eventually lead to an encounter with Shiny Celebi, if you haven't already obtained one from a previous event.
Using a Mystery Box during this event, offers the chance of encountering a Shiny Meltan. The Mystery Box can also be opened more frequently during this event. Full details, including information on Event Bonuses, Wild Encounters, Raids, Research tasks, Avatar Items and more, can be found in the source link below.

Last week, we shared the unfortunate news that generative AI had been used in artwork that had made the top 300 entries of the Pokémon TCG Illustration Contest 2024. On Tuesday, the official Pokémon TCG account on Twitter, which is controlled by The Pokémon Company, made the announcement that select entrants from the top 300 finalists of the contest had "violated the official contest rules" and that "entrants in violation of the rules have been disqualified from the contest". It was also confirmed that additional artists participating in the contest would be selected to replace them. The statement went on to claim that they are "committed to upholding the integrity of the Pokémon TCG Illustration Contest".
