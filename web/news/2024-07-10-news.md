Pokémon GO recently celebrated its eighth anniversary on July 6th, 2024. The Pokémon GO team at Niantic released a statement to say they have been "overjoyed seeing Trainers from across the world and all walks of life come together with their passion for exploring, catching, battling, making new friends, and learning more about Pokémon over the last eight years”. The statement went on to say that they have "continued to grow Pokémon GO with features, events, new ways to discover Pokémon, and more".

Japanese underwear brand HIPSHOP has added six new Pokémon designs to its men's collection. The "Pokémon Series" line began in July 2020 with six products, and has since grown to thirty with latest additions, which include Koraidon, Miraidon, Sprigatito, Fuecoco, Quaxly, and a further Pikachu design. Sadly these aren’t available outside of Japan, which is probably for the best because I want to buy them all!
