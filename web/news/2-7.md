Twitch Plays Pokémon, the social experiment which allows multiple users to participate in a single game of Pokémon, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week. On February 12th 2014, the channel went live with a game of Pokémon Red, which exploded in popularity over its 16 continuous days of gameplay. Over 1.16 million people participated, and it won a Guinness World Record for "most users to input a command to play a live streamed videogame". The channel has continued to stream a variety of different Pokémon games over the years, including ROM hacks.

To mark the channel’s first decade, Twitch Plays Pokémon are going back to the beginning with Pokémon Red, [which users can participate in right now](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon)!
