#### Feature: Interview with Michael Haigney

Michael Haigney (Mike) was the original Voice Director for the Pokémon anime and the first four movies, responsible for adapting the scripts for an English audience. He is also the voice actor who provided the voices for dozens of Pokémon heard throughout the early Pokémon anime, such as Ash's Charmander and Snorlax, Misty's Psyduck, and James's Koffing and Weezing. Michael's voiced Pokémon can also be heard in several video games, such as _Pokémon Puzzle League_ and the _Super Smash Bros._ franchise of games. These days, he attends conventions and hosts his own podcast, _Original Pokéman_. We are excited to share our interview with him for Johto Times!
