Last weekend, The Pokémon World Championships 2023 took place in Yokohama Japan, crowning new champions for Pokémon Unite, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, Pokémon GO and Pokémon Scarlet & Violet. Unfortunately, there have been [reports of players being disqualified](https://twitter.com/vgccorner/status/1689847256944656385) from the Scarlet & Violet tournament, failing the strict checks that organisers have in place to check for Pokémon that have been hacked. [According to the replies](https://twitter.com/TrainerRobVGC/status/1689967981131132928) for one individual that got disqualified, it seems there is a lack of sympathy from the community.

During the closing ceremony of The Pokémon World Championships 2023, TPC President Tsunekazu Ishihara took to the stage to make several announcements. In Pokémon Unite, three additional Pokémon will be added to the roster from September 14th, starting with Blaziken, with Mimikyu and Meowscarada coming at a later date. New details on the second part of Pokémon Scarlet & Violet's DLC, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero, were also announced. You will be able to catch first partner Pokémon (starters) from the previous eight generations of games. Additionally, a new Tera Type was announced that appeared to be connected to Terapagos, although nothing further was confirmed.
In the Trading Card Game, Paradox Pokémon will be coming to the TCG later this year in the fall of 2023 as Ancient and Future Pokémon. Six cards were shown featuring Scream Tail, Brute Bonnet, Roaring Moon EX, Iron Bundle, Iron Moth and Iron Valiant EX. Ace Spec cards are also making a return in 2024, a classification of trading card that was first introduced with the Boundaries Crossed expansion in 2012 during the Black & White era.
Finally, it was announced that next year’s Pokémon World Championships in 2024 will be taking place in Honolulu, Hawai’i. For full details on all the announcements, check out the source below.
