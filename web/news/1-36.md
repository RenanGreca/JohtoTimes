Last week, Nintendo confirmed that it would be ending its online services for its 3DS and Wii U consoles in early April 2024. This will impact most Pokémon titles on the systems that require an online connection to trade, battle, or interact with other players across the world. Nintendo did confirm, however, that it will still be possible to use Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter, but that these services “may also end at some point in the future”.
