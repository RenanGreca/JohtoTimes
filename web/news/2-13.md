The latest Pokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet set, Temporal Forces, was released on March 22nd. The set contains over 160 cards and sees the return of ACE SPEC cards, which were first introduced during the Black & White era. As if that wasn’t enough, players won’t be catching a break any time soon: Just last week, it was announced that Scarlet & Violet: Twilight Masquerade would release in May. Will you have time to collect them all before the next new set?

An important reminder to 3DS and Wii U owners that Nintendo will be discontinuing its online services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software on April 8th, 2024, at 16:00 PDT. This will impact Pokémon X & Y, Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire, Sun & Moon, and Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon. Online battling, trading, and any additional services that require an internet connection will no longer be possible after this date.

This won’t immediately affect the use of Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter, however Nintendo have stated that support for these “may also end at some point in the future”.
