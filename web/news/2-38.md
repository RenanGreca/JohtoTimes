Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced that they have filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair, Inc., developer of Palworld, seeking an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages. The lawsuit claims Palworld infringes multiple patent rights.
Palworld released in January 2024, and after just one month on sale, it had 25 million players playing its game, with 15 million copies sold on Steam alone.
Just two days prior, [The Pokémon Company announced](https://gamebiz-jp.translate.goog/news/392569?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp) that it had won $15 million in a copyright and intellectual property theft lawsuit against several Chinese companies for the game Pocket Monster Reissue.
Pocketpair [issued a statement](https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16) to confirm they had received notice of the lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations. The statement goes on to say that they will “be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit”.
