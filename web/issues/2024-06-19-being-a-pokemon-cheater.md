Another week, another issue of the Johto Times newsletter! In Vol. 2, issue 25, I am sharing a personal story of cheating by playing Pokémon, the reasons that caused it, and why I ultimately decided that it wasn’t worth it. Maybe some of my readers can relate to it. Regardless, it was a fun trip back down memory lane, and I hope you enjoy it! In addition to this feature, there’s also a recap of the latest Pokémon news, and the return of the Johto Times mailbag!
If you would like to share something for the mailbag yourself, details can be found at the end of the newsletter. Enjoy!
