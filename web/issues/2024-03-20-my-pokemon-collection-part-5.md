Vol. 2, issue 12 of the Johto Times is here! The music of Pokémon is a side of the franchise I am very passionate about so, for this issue, I thought I would share some very special items from my collection, focused entirely on the music of the mainline Pokémon games! There’s also more Pokémon news, so sit back, and enjoy!
