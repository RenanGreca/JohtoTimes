Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 13 of the Johto Times. In 1999, Australia was host to the Pokémon PokéTour, which gave fans on the continent their first look at the Pokémon TCG and the chance to obtain their very own Mew, that could be transferred to copies of Pokémon Red, Blue & Yellow. Tony Cocking has kindly shared his memory of attending the event. We’ve also got the latest news to help you catch up on recent announcements from the world of Pokémon!
