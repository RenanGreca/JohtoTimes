Welcome to issue 46 of the Johto Times! Today we will be sharing a special interview with Michael Haigney, the original Voice Director for the English-adapted Pokémon anime from 1998 until around 2002, who worked on the anime and the first four Pokémon movies. He voiced beloved characters such as Charmander and Psyduck as well as many other Pokémon during his time at 4Kids Entertainment. It was a pleasure to speak to Michael about his time working on the show, and I am excited to share this interview with our readers!
