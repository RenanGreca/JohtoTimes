Welcome to issue 39 of the Johto Times newsletter. For this issue I decided to take the opportunity to express why Pokémon Crystal is my favourite Pokémon game. Today, November 2nd 2023, marks 22 years since the game launched in Europe, and while I don’t remember the exact date I obtained it, I know it was around this time that I began playing this wonderful game. I hope you’ll allow me some of your time to express why I love it so much. In addition to this, we have the latest Pokémon news, and more from the Johto Times mailbag.
