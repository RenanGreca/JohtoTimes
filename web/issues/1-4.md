It’s hard to believe that we're nearing one whole month since the Johto Times officially launched. Time really does HM02, eh? Today, I wish to introduce the first of a series of posts dedicated to my Pokémon journey: The Legacy of Pokémon.

The Legacy of Pokémon is part of a gigantic editorial I wrote last year, in order to preserve my memories and time with the series. If older fans care to reminisce, or younger fans get to see a point of view from a long-time supporter, and find it useful, then it was worth writing about. I've decided to split it into several parts, so it can be enjoyed in a more manageable way. Part one will focus on the origins of how I got into the series, a time before I even picked up my first Pokémon game.

Speaking of preserving memories, I felt it was important to let readers know once again that the Nintendo eShop for Wii U and 3DS will be closing down for good on March 27th 2023. Hundreds of titles, which include many Pokémon games, will no longer be available for legal purchase. Most importantly, Pokémon Bank and Poké Transporter will no longer be unavailable after this date, preventing many Pokémon games up to the Nintendo 3DS being transferred to Pokémon HOME and the latest generation. [Full details can be found on the Official Nintendo website](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Purchasing/Download-games/Nintendo-eShop/Notice-of-End-of-Purchases-in-Nintendo-eShop-for-Wii-U-and-Nintendo-3DS-Update-July-2022-2174073.html).

Additionally, Pokémon Day came and went on February 27th with updates on new projects and current games. The most notable announcement was downloadable content for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet titled “The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero”, releasing in two parts this year. The Teal Mask is planned for release in the Autumn, while the Indigo Disk will arrive in the Winter. Brand-new Pokémon were also revealed, which include two new Paradox Pokémon: Walking Wake and Iron Leaves. I was able to catch both of them in raids, but struggled on for a few hours. I hope you all have better luck than I did!

We also got an update on Pokémon Sleep, an application that monitors how well you sleep and provides data every morning. I am not convinced it’s something I will personally use, but I’m willing to give it a try. There’s also a new device called the Pokémon GO Plus+, a peripheral device that will work with Sleep, and is compatible with Pokémon GO. I was surprised to see no mention of classic Pokémon titles coming to Nintendo Switch Online, or any new Mystery Dungeon game, but I suppose the door is still open for those to come in the future. 

The best announcement for me? The reveal of Pokémon TCG Classic, a premium product with a fancy fold-out game board, pre-constructed decks and a toolbox containing accessories to help you play the game. It’s definitely something I have my eye on, providing I can beat the scalpers to it when it releases later this year in the West. If anyone has any thoughts on the Pokémon Presents broadcast that they want to share, feel free to leave a comment below!

That’s it for another week, but please do check out that Legacy of Pokémon feature on the link above!
