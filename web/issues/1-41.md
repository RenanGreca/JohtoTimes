Welcome to issue 41 of the Johto Times newsletter. This week, I am pleased to share a special interview with Craig Turvey, the winner of the Create-a-Snorlax Pokémon Card Contest hosted by Wizards of the Coast in 2002. Craig’s artwork appeared on a promo card, and he was one of only two Western artists to have had the privilege during that era. In addition to this interview, I am also publishing some research into the Create-a-Snorlax Contest, which has led to some exciting discoveries! Read on if you want to know more…

As usual, we also have the latest Pokémon news and more from the Johto Times mailbag!
