Welcome to Vol. 2, Issue 9 of the Johto Times! This week, I’m excited to share an interview with The PokéMasters, a hugely popular Pokémon fan website that began in 1998 and was considered one of the top fan websites dedicated to the franchise. It had a thriving forum community, which is still active to this day. I was privileged to speak with Lady Vulpix, who currently runs the website and community.
There’s also plenty of Pokémon-related news thanks to the recent [Pokémon Presents presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNl7YxERV_8) on Pokémon Day, which revealed information on new titles and updates for Pokémon games, products, and services from the company. Let’s get right into it!
