Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 23 of the Johto Times! This week, I’m excited to share an interview with Tim Street, the former Editor of Pokémon Official Magazine, which ran for just two issues in the United Kingdom between October and December 2004. Tim was happy to share his memories of this short-lived magazine. We also have a recap of the latest Pokémon news.
