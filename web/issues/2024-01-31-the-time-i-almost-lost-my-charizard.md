Welcome to Vol 2, Issue 5 of the Johto Times newsletter! Today I share a sad story from my childhood about the time I almost lost my Charizard Pokémon trading card. I actually wrote this back in February 2023, just as I began writing the Johto Times newsletter, but couldn’t find a good time to share it. We also have the latest Pokémon news, and more from the Johto Times mailbag!
