Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 31 of the Johto Times newsletter! This is the sixth part of an ongoing series that shares my memories and experiences of Pokémon through the generations. This week, I'm sharing my time with Generation VI, which covers my experiences in the Kalos region with Pokémon Y, my return to Hoenn with Pokémon Omega Ruby, and my introduction to a game which brought about a second wave of Pokémania across the globe: Pokémon GO. As usual, I also put together a recap of the latest Pokémon news from the past week.
