Vol. 2, issue 19 of the Johto Times newsletter is here! In this issue, I am excited to share a very special interview with Tsukasa Hosono, who was one of the winners of a Pokémon Snap Best Photo Contest in 1999. Tsukasa’s prize was fifteen special Pokémon cards that contain a picture of the Charmander that he captured in the game. They are the only ones in existence. Tsukasa shares his memories of the contest and growing up with Pokémon along with some great photographs! As usual, we also have a recap of this week's Pokémon news!
