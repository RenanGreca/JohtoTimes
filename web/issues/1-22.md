Welcome to issue 22 of the Johto Times! In this issue, we are sharing an interview with Lewtwo, a Pokémon archivist attempting to preserve the franchise’s media, which includes visual art assets, music, and video. As a huge fan of game preservation, it was important to me that we highlight the great work people like him are doing for the Pokémon community.
Additionally, and for anyone interested, I was a guest on episode 135 of the Pokémon Variety Hour podcast, which aired on June 26th 2023, where I discussed Johto Times, shared my opinions on the Pokémon franchise, and played a Pokémon guessing game!
