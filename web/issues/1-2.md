Welcome to another edition of the Johto Times! Today, I will be making the first addition to our Pokémon [Collections](https://johto.substack.com/s/collections), with a post featuring some items of my own. While I don’t have a vast treasure trove like other Pokémon fans and collectors out there, many of the items are personal and mean a great deal to me. I am excited to share them, and hopefully more in the future too!

I also want to take a moment to say thank you to everyone who has subscribed to the Johto Times so far. At the time of writing, we have reached **50** subscribers, all of which are receiving this very update! If each of you were a Pokémon in Bill’s PC, you’d be taking up almost two whole boxes. That’s pretty cool!

Since I started the Johto Times on February 6th, 2023 (which also happens to be Mewtwo’s birthday), I have been busy writing as much content as I possibly can in my spare time, which means there are months of newsletters scheduled to go! Over the next few weeks, you will see at least two interviews, a cool memory from a fan, and the start of a series that delves deeply into my journey with the Pokémon franchise so far.

It means an awful lot to me that there are people who care about what we are doing. I hope that you will find our content enjoyable, and decide to stick with us in the weeks, months, and with any luck, years to come.
