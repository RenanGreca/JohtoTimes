Welcome to another issue of the Johto Times! This week, I am sharing the third part of my Pokémon collection, focusing on some of the classic Pokémon movies I grew up with. Maybe you had these too? We also take a look at the weekly Pokémon news and share our very first mailbag question!

Before we begin, I would like to announce that the Johto Times has this week reached 200 subscribers! Our newsletter is read across 30 US states and 40 countries, and we are incredibly proud of what we are doing and thankful to everyone who has chosen to subscribe to us so far.
