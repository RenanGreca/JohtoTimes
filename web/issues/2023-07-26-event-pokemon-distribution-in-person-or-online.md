Welcome to the twenty-fifth issue of the Johto Times! For this issue, I asked myself a question: Should official Pokémon distributions be done in person or online? I weigh up the pros and cons of each, and share my thoughts on receiving Pokémon at exciting in-person events, compared to the convenience and accessibility of obtaining them at home via Mystery Gift events over WiFi. As always, we have the latest Pokémon news, as well as more from our mailbag!
