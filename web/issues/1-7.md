Welcome back for another issue of Johto Times! This week, I am sharing some more cool items from my personal Pokémon collection. Everything in this feature will have been purchasable between the years of 1999 and 2001. They include electronic toys, a tabletop game, and a Pokémon card that means a lot to me for very personal reasons. I received some really nice feedback from the last collection feature I shared, so I hope that this one will be equally enjoyable. You can check it out by clicking the link below:

I want to take a moment to highlight some other members of the Johto Times team: Roy, Josh and Dragonfree, who are being incredibly helpful by proofreading all the content I write before it is published here on Johto Times. Roy initially offered to help in the early stages of the newsletter when I didn’t have a second pair of eyes to check the content, and supported me to get the initial bulk of content in good shape and ready for publication, much of which has still yet to be published. Josh has been on board for around a month, and he has been super helpful by checking everything over and offering his support. Dragonfree joined the team within the past week, and got straight to work looking over everything that will be published in the immediate future.

This will also be the final reminder from us that the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U eShop will be closing on March 27th 2023. If there are any Pokémon titles you have been interested in buying for these platforms that you can’t buy at retail, then your time is almost up. If you made any last-minute purchases, let us know in the comments below!
