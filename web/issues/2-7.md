It’s time for Vol. 2, Issue 7 of the Johto Times newsletter! This week, I want to reflect on the backwards compatibility of Pokémon titles and highlight the current landscape for connecting and trading between classic Pokémon games. We also have some great artwork submitted to the Johto Times mailbag, so be sure to check that out too!
