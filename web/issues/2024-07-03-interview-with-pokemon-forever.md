Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 27 of the Johto Times newsletter! This week, I am sharing my interview with Christopher Fritz, aka Meowth346 from Pokémon Forever. Between January 1999 and June 2005, Chris provided tons of useful information about the first three generations of Pokémon titles on his website, helping people understand their mechanics. His work was well-respected across the fan community, and I am honoured to be sharing his thoughts here today. We also have a recap of Pokémon news to share, and we will dip into the mailbag to share another contribution from our readers.
