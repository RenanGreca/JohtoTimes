When I started this newsletter on February 6th 2023, I stated that I was willing to listen and tweak the newsletter as we started to grow. After three months of listening to feedback from our growing audience, I have decided to change how content will be shared. Until now, we would normally give a link directly to the content for subscribers to click, and keep the emails we sent out to them short. We will be adjusting the newsletter as follows:
*   The featured content will be included within each email
    
*   The newsletter will be more structured to include news, featured content and a mailbag section (coming soon)
    
*   A copy of each featured article will still be available online in the relevant sections
    
I think this is a good compromise, and I will test the waters to see how it's received.
