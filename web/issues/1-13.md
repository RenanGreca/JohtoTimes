A warm welcome to Issue 13 of the Johto Times newsletter! This week’s content includes news on how a trading card store in Japan is restricting sales to adults in an effort to get them into the hands of their target audience and reduce reselling. We also have a special feature from a Pokémon fan in Japan, who has shared some of his Pokémon discoveries with us.
