Welcome to issue 16 of the Johto Times! This week, we are sharing a feature on the topic of preserving Pokémon, offering information and solutions to help retain our Pokémon game data. We also have news on Pokémon GO and Pokémon HOME, as well as more from our mailbag!

You may have noticed some new banners and branding across the newsletter. This pixel artwork was created by yours truly, and shows the Tin Tower of Ecruteak City in Johto. The piece is called “Johto Times” and was my first attempt at pixel art, which took around six hours of work over two days to complete. I don’t consider myself to be an artist, so I had to sit back and ask myself, “Did I just create that?”.
I believe it perfectly encapsulates the nostalgia and vision of Johto Times. Feel free to let me know what you think to it in the comments!
