For issue 28, I bring together three of my passions: video games, photography, and Pokémon. Over the past year, I have been experimenting with my Game Boy Camera and enjoying the results I can get from something so limited, using Pokémon as my subject. In this feature, I will be sharing those results. I hope you will like them!
