When I was growing up and learning about Pokémon for the first time, I would frequent many Pokémon fan websites, learning all I could about the latest Pokémon news and information. One of these was Pokémon Elite 2000 (PE2K), run by its founder Ray, which covered a variety of information I found incredibly helpful and interesting. On a personal note, I used to chat with Ray as friends all the way back in 2003 on MSN messenger, amazed that its founder would give a fanboy of both Pokémon and the PE2K community the time of day!
Sadly, the community closed its doors in 2007, but just before the Johto Times was launched, I decided to track him down and say hello again. Because of this, I am delighted and honoured to be interviewing him for Johto Times, to share more about this old community from long ago, and hopefully inform and educate readers about how awesome this website was.

In other news: March 24th 2023 marked the end of Ash’s Pokémon anime saga, which dates back to April 1997 when the show was first broadcast in Japan, with “Pokémon - I Choose You!”. While I gave up watching the anime at the end of season 5 (Master Quest), I decided to watch this final mini season to say goodbye to a character who has blessed our screens for over a quarter of a century. A trailer for Pokémon Horizons: The Series has now been  released, which will mark the beginning of a brand-new chapter for the anime. Check it out below:
Finally, I am delighted to confirm that we have now reached 120 subscribers to the Johto Times! As our community continues to grow, I will be looking at new ways of engaging with our readers. For now, I will continue to focus on writing up some (hopefully) engaging content for everyone to enjoy, and extend my thanks to everyone who has been reading our content and engaging with us every week!
