Welcome to issue 35 of the Johto Times! We are now in October, the nights are becoming darker, and things are getting spooky! Today’s feature is a short but personal story of my memories with shiny Pokémon, across the first seven generations of mainline games, and some of the most exciting moments from my time playing through the series. However, not every encounter leaves a positive impression… We also have the latest Pokémon news, and more from our mailbag!
