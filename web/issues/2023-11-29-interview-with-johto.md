Welcome to a very special issue of the Johto Times! Today in issue 43, we are excited to share an interview with four members of the musical group Johto, who were responsible for most of the songs on the Totally Pokémon and the third Pokémon movie soundtracks, including Pokémon Johto (Do-do-do, do, do-do), and Pokérap GS.
As we head into December, the Johto Times team will be winding down for the remainder of 2023, but we have newsletters scheduled to go out automatically to subscribers. As a result, news and mailbag content will be taking a back seat until after the new year.
