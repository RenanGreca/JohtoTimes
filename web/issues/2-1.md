Welcome to the first issue of Volume 2, and a happy new year to all of our readers! In Volume 1 we had the privilege of interviewing some amazing guests, listening to your nostalgic Pokémon memories, and sharing some Pokémon collections, features and opinion pieces that resonated with so many of you. You can expect much more in Volume 2, and we hope you will stay with us to see what we have in store! 

If you were playing Pokémon around the year 1999, you will have almost certainly heard of PokéGods, fake or rumoured Pokémon which took the internet and playgrounds by storm. In this issue, I delve deep into the topic and remind you of the time you likely fell for some of these. We also have a recap of all the major Pokémon news that was announced throughout December and early January plus the return of the Johto Times mailbag!
