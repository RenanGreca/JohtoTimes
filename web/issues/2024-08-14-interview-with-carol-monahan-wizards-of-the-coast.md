Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 33 of the Johto Times newsletter! Every so often, Johto Times is fortunate enough to speak to people that played an important part in Pokémon’s history and highlight their stories and contributions. I am grateful to be doing that again today with Carol Monahan, the former Director of Sales and Logistics at Wizards of the Coast, who worked for the company between 1993 and 2000. When the company received the licence to the Pokémon Trading Card Game, Carol was responsible for getting large volumes of product shipped out to retailers. It's an insightful interview, showing the earliest days of the Pokémon TCG from an angle you may not have heard before, and we hope you’ll enjoy it.
Then, as usual, we’ve also got a recap of the latest Pokémon news!
