When I was younger I was fascinated by The Pokémon Center New York store. It seemed like such an amazing place to visit, but since I lived in the UK, I was unable to check it out for myself while it was open for business. I used to hear so much about the venue from online Pokémon websites and magazines, especially the exclusive items on sale there, and all the cool events that used to take place. 

Last year I came across an incredible website that has been making efforts to preserve everything about the now defunct Pokémon store, with information, personal stories and a gallery filled with photographs and video footage showing off what this magical place had. These priceless memories will mean people can be reminded or educate themselves about it for years to come.

For our fifth issue, I was fortunate enough to speak to the two individuals making a concerted effort to maintain and update the Pokémon Center New York Historical Website, and attempt to highlight all the fantastic and exciting work they are doing. Julie and Grace spoke with me about how they first got involved, the progress they’ve made so far, and shared tons of information about the various features of the Center, such as the _Gotta Catch ‘Em All!™ Station!_, which originally distributed event Pokémon to attendees.

I recognise how much time and love has gone into maintaining this incredible archive of information, and the enthusiasm Julie and Grace have for this project is infectious. From the bottom of my heart, I wish them all the success in the world in discovering more stories, photographs, video footage and the missing pieces of the Pokémon Center New York’s history. This interview is the first we are publishing for Johto Times, and there’s more to come in the future!

Finally, I am happy to share that Johto Times has reached over 100 subscribers! This was achieved in less than 30 days, and a number I didn’t think was possible to reach until at least a year into this project. I want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to everyone who has subscribed and read the content of our newsletters so far. I truly hope that you, and those who find us in the future, enjoy the content we publish here.

Please consider sharing Johto Times with your friends and loved ones who also adore Pokémon!
