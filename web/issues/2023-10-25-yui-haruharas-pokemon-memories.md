Happy Halloween from the Johto Times! For issue 38, we have some Pokémon memories from a Pokémon fan called Yui, who tells us about their earliest Pokémon memories, and why we love Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl so much! Yeah… that last one was a bit of a trick, but we hope you’ll find this issue a real treat! If you’re doing anything Pokémon-related this Halloween, whether it be a party costume, a pumpkin carving, or have created any cool artwork, be sure to send it over to our mailbag and we will try and feature them in the next issue!
