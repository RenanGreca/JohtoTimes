It’s time for Vol. 2, issue 22 of the Johto Times newsletter! This week I am happy to share an interview with The Pokémon Tower, a huge collection of fanworks which includes stories, fanart, and fanvids. It opened in December 1998, making it one of the oldest surviving websites dedicated to fan media. As always, there's also a recap of the latest Pokémon news!  
As I mentioned in the last issue, I am hoping to bring back our mailbag in the near future, and you are welcome to contribute! If you have a short story, fan art, some Pokémon questions, photographs from your collection, or precious Pokémon memories, [contact details can be found by visiting this page](https://johto.substack.com/s/mailbag).
