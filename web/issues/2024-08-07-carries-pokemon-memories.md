Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 32 of the Johto Times newsletter! One of the things I love the most about this newsletter is when I can share the memories of Pokémon fans who express how much the franchise meant to them growing up. I’m delighted to be sharing another one today from a fan called Carrie, who talks about what Pokémon meant to her, and highlights one very special birthday party she had in 1999!
Before we get to that though, there’s also been a tremendous amount of Pokémon news this week which I’m going to try and recap!
