For this first issue of the Johto Times, I felt it would be appropriate to introduce myself and give readers an idea of the person behind this project. Here are ten (or more) Pokémon-related facts about me:

1.  My name is Darren, I live in the United Kingdom and I first learned of Pokémon in 1999 when I overheard my classmates talk about the anime and the trading card game. Like most kids, I was immediately hooked by the strange and wonderful creatures known as Pokémon.

2.  My first Pokémon game was Blue which I finally received in 2001 with a Game Boy Color that my mum bought me. I was beyond excited and happy with the game and played it constantly. My starter was a Charmander!

3.  My favourite mainline Pokémon game is Crystal, purely because of how it made me feel when it originally launched, and for the many great memories playing it with my friends.

4.  My favourite Pokémon is Rowlet. The scene during Pokémon Sun and Moon where you lift your chosen starter into the air was quite adorable, and his personality in the anime solidified his place as number one.

5.  I have a collection of Pokémon items that include video games, trading cards, plush toys and many obscure items from the late 90’s and early 2000’s. I even own every English Pokémon Mini game!

6.  In 2017 I released a story-driven Pokémon album that I produced and directed, which raised money for Child’s Play Charity. It was created in celebration of the 20th anniversary of Pokémon Red and Green in Japan.

7.  When I was 16 years old, I created an online Pokémon website, chatroom and forum, which gave me a taste for community management and provided essential skills that were valuable into adulthood. It helped me form friendships during a difficult time in my life, after years of significant bullying during my school years.

8.  I cried while playing Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. It’s a masterpiece!

9.  I’m a big fan of Pokémon GO, a game that has had a positive impact on my physical and mental wellbeing, and helped me find friends locally that I never would have made otherwise.

10.  In the next few years, It’s my ambition to complete several Pokémon trading card game sets I started in childhood. Between 2019 and 2022 I was able to complete the Base, Jungle, Fossil and Team Rocket collections.
