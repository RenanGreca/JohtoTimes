An updated Johto Times logo with a festive touch to mark this holiday season!
Welcome to issue 44 of the Johto Times! As we enter the start of the festive period, the Johto Times team are winding down for the remainder of the year to take a well deserved rest. This will mean that I am taking a break from adding news and mailbag entries to the newsletter and focusing on features exclusively. Any major news announcements will be shared on the [Johto Times Mastodon account](https://donphan.social/@johto), and I will do my best to recap any highlights in the new year. If you would like to contribute something to our mailbag for next year, you can find our contact email on there if you wish to contribute something to our mailbag for next year.
In this issue, we are sharing the special memories of a Pokémon fan called Rachael Gater, dating back to Christmas 1999 when she and her brother received copies of an exciting new Game Boy game!
