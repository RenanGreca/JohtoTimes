Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 36 of the Johto Times newsletter! In this issue, I am delighted to be sharing our interview with The PokéGym. We delve into the history of this Pokémon TCG strategy website, which dates all the way back to 1999! It even served as the community forum for Wizards of the Coast when they swooped in to save it from closure in 2001. Mike Martin, also known as PokePop, kindly offered to answer my questions on behalf of the PokéGym team to discuss the rich history of the site and its important place in the Pokémon fan community.
