Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 28 of the Johto Times newsletter. In this week’s edition, I am sharing a special feature to reflect on Nintendo’s late president and CEO Satoru Iwata, and highlight what he did for Pokémon. Today, July 11th, 2024, marks nine years since Iwata passed away due to complications from an operation to remove a tumour from his bile duct.

In addition to this feature, I have a recap of the latest Pokémon news, plus more from the Johto Times mailbag.
