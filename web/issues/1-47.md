Welcome to Issue 47 of the Johto Times! We hope that everyone who celebrated had a wonderful Christmas with their loved ones. In our penultimate issue of the year, we are delighted to be sharing an interview with Dragonfree from The Cave of Dragonflies. I am proud to say that I have a close connection with the website as an affiliate in the mid 2000s when I ran my own Pokémon fan website, and she has kindly been involved with editing Johto Times. I am proud to be highlighting a long-running and highly respected website, and the great work Dragonfree has done with The Cave of Dragonflies throughout the years, and I hope you will enjoy it!
Subscribers can expect a special Johto Times issue in their inboxes this Sunday, December 31st 2023 at 14:00 UTC, as we recap our year and look back at the content we have featured, as well as my own personal thoughts on the future of the newsletter. The newsletter will then return to its regular schedule, every Thursday at the usual time of 14:00 UTC.
