Welcome to issue 20 of the Johto Times! This week, we are very happy to share another interview, this time with Ayano from Blue Moon Falls, a Pokémon fansite that focuses on the original two generations of the series, which looks and feels like a classic Pokémon website from the early 2000s! We also have the latest Pokémon news, and more from our mailbag.
