Welcome to Issue 30 of the Johto Times! This week, we have another feature directly from Japan, featuring all kinds of weird and wonderful Pokémon products, landmarks, and displays!
As you might remember, back in [Issue 13](https://johto.substack.com/p/vol1-13) we did a similar feature with our friend Vectrex. Well, this time around, we are delighted to be introducing SteC, a Pokémon fan originally from the United Kingdom, who has lived and worked in Japan for the past six years! As usual, we also have the latest Pokémon news and some questions that were sent to our mailbag. Enjoy!
