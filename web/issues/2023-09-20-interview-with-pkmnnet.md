Welcome to the latest issue of Johto Times! For issue 33, we speak to Jeroen (Joeno) and Mike (Typhlosion) from the long-running Pokémon fan website PKMN.NET! We also have the latest news, and more from the Johto Times mailbag!
Before we begin today, I want to let you know that [Johto Times now has a Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/JohtoTimes), where I will be doing occasional, casual Pokémon streams. Some of these broadcasts will be themed around playing video games, trading card pack openings, and looking over some cool Pokémon items from childhood. It’s also an opportunity to chat, and to speak with other Johto Times fans, so I hope you’ll consider giving us a follow! Full details on upcoming streams will be available on our Twitch channel, and we hope to include highlight videos in the future for those who missed out!
