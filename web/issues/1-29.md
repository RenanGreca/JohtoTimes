Welcome to issue 29 of the Johto Times! This week, our newsletter pays tribute to the very first Pokémon event outside of Japan, which took place in Topeka, Kansas, in 1998. The video games weren’t due to reach store shelves for a further month, and at this point, the vast majority of people had no clue that Pokémania was coming. The city was even renamed Topikachu for the day! This month marks twenty-five years since the event, and we have been blessed to receive some great personal stories from the kids (now adults) that attended the event, including lots of great photographs that they and their families took.
