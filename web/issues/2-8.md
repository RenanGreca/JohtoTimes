Another week, another issue of the Johto Times newsletter! Vol. 2, Issue 8 marks the final week before Pokémon Day on February 27th, 2024, a day that will mark 28 years since the original release of Pokémon Red & Green in Japan. For the past few years, the Pokémon Company has marked the occasion with exciting announcements during a live stream on their [official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFctpiB_Hnlk3ejWfHqSm6Q). I am happy to confirm that this trend hasn't been broken, and a Pokémon Presents presentation will be happening once again on February 27th, 2024, at 14:00 UTC. I am hopeful for lots of great announcements next week, and you can be sure that Johto Times will recap everything!

In this issue, I wanted to share some ideas I’ve been thinking about for a while: a Pokémon Legends-style game set in the land of ancient Johto, called Legends: Celebi. I am sharing them here in the hope that someday, a game just like it may be created! We’ve also got some Pokémon news and more from the Johto Times mailbag!

On a side note, I was recently invited to take part in a podcast by _As The Pokeball Turns_ to discuss my early memories of Pokémon during ‘Pokémania’, my experience with Pokémon GO, and the first anniversary of the Johto Times newsletter.
