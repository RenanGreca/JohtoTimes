Welcome to this week’s Johto Times! For Vol. 2, issue 15, I am happy to share some very special Pokémon memories from a fan called Dazz who has run the popular website [The Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com), dedicated to the collection and archival of materials from video games, since 2006. He also plays a key role at [Did You Know Gaming](https://didyouknowgaming.com/), a popular video game-focused blog and web series, which covers trivia, facts, and investigations into gaming's lost secrets. We also have the latest Pokémon news and information from the world of Pokémon!
