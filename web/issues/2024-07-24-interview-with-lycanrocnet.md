Welcome to another weekly issue of the Johto Times newsletter! In Vol. 2, issue 30, the focus is on Lycanroc.Net, a mixed media fan website run by Cat, who I am very happy to interview. His history with creating fan sites dates back to 2003, with sites including Mario Minus World, Buizel.net, Floatzel.net, and eventually Lycanroc.Net. Cat also ran a forum community called Victory Road, which was active for eleven years.
There’s also the usual recap of Pokémon news, and some more from the Johto Times mailbag!
