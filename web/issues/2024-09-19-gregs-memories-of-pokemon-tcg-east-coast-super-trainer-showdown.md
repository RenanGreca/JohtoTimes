It’s time for Vol. 2, issue 38 of the Johto Times newsletter! This week, we go back in time and share the memories of a Pokémon fan called Greg. He attended the Pokémon TCG East Coast Super Trainer Showdown event, which took place in June 2001. Greg tells us about his experience playing in the tournament, and how he later became a Gym Leader for his local Pokémon League! We also have a recap of the very latest Pokémon news!
I would like to take a moment to say hello to all of our subscribers, and thank them for their support. I would love to see the newsletter reach even more people, and I have been doing my best to spread the word to as many people as possible. If you have friends and loved ones who may be interested in the work Johto Times is doing to document and preserve the early history of Pokémon and its fan community, be sure to share it with them!
With that out of the way, let’s begin this week’s issue!
