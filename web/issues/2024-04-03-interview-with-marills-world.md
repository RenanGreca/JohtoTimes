Welcome to issue 14 of the Johto Times! This week, we are sharing an interview with a small classic website called Marills World, a website I personally visited when I was a teenager! I had the pleasure of speaking with Dom, its webmaster, about his memories of the website and his love of Pokémon. We’ve also got the latest Pokémon news, which includes a very important announcement relating to the future of online connectivity with Pokémon on 3DS, so don’t miss out!
