Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 29 of the Johto Times newsletter. This week, I am beyond delighted to share our interview with Joe Merrick, the webmaster for Serebii.net. For many of us, his website requires little introduction: Joe has dedicated almost twenty-five years of his life to maintaining the site, covering all manner of Pokémon games and products. Serebii.net is usually one of the first communities to break the news on the latest Pokémon announcements, and is held in high regard as a reliable and trustworthy source.

To mark this notable milestone, Joe answered over forty of my questions, covering a wide range of topics, including how he first got into the series, the history of his website, working closely with the Pokémon Company, and sharing his opinions on some of the many controversies that have been a talking point with fans throughout the years.
