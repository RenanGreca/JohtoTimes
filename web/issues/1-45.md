Hello, readers, and welcome to another issue of Johto Times! In issue 45, we are honoured to be sharing an interview with The Pokémon Factory, a classic Pokémon fan website dating back to 1998 with a focus on fake Pokémon created by its members. We spoke to Bonzai, one of the original administrators who ran the website between 2002 and 2018. Later this month on December 27th, The Pokémon Factory marks the 25th anniversary of its original creation, which is a notable milestone that we are proud to celebrate.

As we mentioned in our previous issue, the Johto Times team are taking a well deserved break through December, which means we won’t be sharing news or mailbag entries. Any major news announcements will be shared on the [Johto Times Mastodon account](https://donphan.social/@johto), and I will do my best to recap any highlights in the new year. You can find our contact email address there if you wish to provide something for the mailbag.
