Welcome to Vol. 2, issue 39 of the Johto Times newsletter! It has now been one whole year since Pokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet—151 released, a set which encouraged me to start collecting Pokémon cards again after more than twenty years! Since a bit of time has passed, I wanted to reflect on this expansion and my thoughts on collecting Pokémon TCG cards again. As usual, I have also recapped this week in Pokémon news.  

Our little newsletter continues to steadily grow, with more subscribers each week who have taken an interest in what Johto Times aims to do. For those of you who have recently joined, I am immensely thankful. Now, on with this week’s issue!
