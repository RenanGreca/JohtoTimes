Welcome to Vol. 2, Issue 11 of the Johto Times! This week, I’m very happy to be sharing an interview with Pokémon Zeo!, a website that provided resources for people to create their own fake and/or custom cards. The website was created by The Echidna and Purity, formerly of Pokémon Aaah!, on October 13th, 2000, and operated for around fourteen years, before finally shutting down sometime in 2014. On a sentimental note, this was one of the communities I used to visit personally, so I’m super thrilled to be conducting this interview with one of its creators, Purity!
As always, there’s also the latest Pokémon news. We are currently seeking new additions to our mailbag, so if you would like to share anything with us, you can find details on that at the end of this issue!
