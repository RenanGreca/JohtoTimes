It’s time for issue 26 of the Johto Times! Have you ever wondered what it might be like to explore a Pokémon region for real? We are delighted to be sharing an interview with Alex, who has been visiting and exploring the real-world equivalents of Kanto and Johto, in Japan. It’s a very special and awesome journey that we hope our readers will enjoy reading!
We apologise for an error in [last week’s issue](https://johto.substack.com/p/vol1-25), where we shared an incorrect distribution code for a shiny Grimmsnarl. Thank you to one of our readers who pointed out the error. The correct code to redeem the limited-time Pokémon in Scarlet & Violet is THA12022CHAMP, and it can still be obtained until August 18th 2023.
