It’s always fun to look back and remember some of the happier memories of one's life, transporting ourselves to when things felt simpler. Some lucky Pokémon fans had the opportunity to attend official events to watch pro players duke it out in competitive Pokémon titles, snag cool memorabilia and even obtain rare Pokémon through official distributions.
Today we are delighted to be sharing our first addition to the Memories section, with a story by Paul Munn, who was fortunate enough to attend the Pokémon World Exhibition in the year 2000, which took place at the Millennium Dome in London. At the time, the event was hosting the European Finals of the Nintendo Pokémon Championships, and while Paul wasn’t competing in the event himself, he and his friends were there to obtain the mythical Pokémon Mew, as part of an official distribution. 
Paul recounts his memory of the day, and the cool things he got up to at the Millennium Dome, complete with photographs. It’s amazing to think that it originally happened way back in the year 2000, and it’s an excellent opportunity to take a trip back in time and share it with a wider audience.
I couldn’t end today’s issue without giving a mention to Pokémon Day, which is marked on February 27th (the anniversary of Pokémon Red and Green) every year. A Pokémon Presents stream will be taking place on the day from 14:00 UTC, an event that has announced brand-new games and content updates previously.
There is speculation of a new Pokémon Mystery Dungeon title and classic Pokémon games hitting the newly announced Nintendo Switch Online Game Boy and Game Boy Advance applications. Currently, many of the older Pokémon titles can be obtained from the Nintendo eShop for Wii U and 3DS, but with the service closing on March 27th, it would be a good time to make them available elsewhere.
But enough speculation for now. Click the button below to check out Paul’s Memories of Mew!
