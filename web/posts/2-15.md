### Feature: Dazz''s Pokémon Memories
Each Pokémon fan has their own unique memories and stories to share about how they first got into the series. or this week's feature, we are sharing the thoughts of Dazz, a Pokémon fan who started playing the games from the very beginning when they first arrived in the United Kingdom. 
Dazz is known online for his work at The Spriters Resource, which he took over in March, 2006. He is also a valued contributor to the popular YouTube channel and website Did You Know Gaming, for which he writes, edits, voices, and administrates content.

Greetings, everyone! It's a pleasure to introduce myself – I'm Dazz, recognized for my long standing contributions to The Spriters Resource, where I've dedicated over 20 years to curating and archiving video game sprites for enthusiasts and creators alike. Additionally, for the past 11 years, I've been one of the driving forces behind DidYouKnowGaming.
Born in 1991, my journey with video games began at a remarkably young age. Growing up in a tech-savvy household, I was immersed in the world of gaming from the outset. However, it was the advent of Pokémon in the UK that truly ignited my passion. The combination of RPG mechanics, adorable creatures, and an accompanying anime series resonated deeply with me. Thanks to my family's affinity for classic Manga films, I was already well-versed in anime culture, which further fuelled my fascination with Pokémon.

From the moment I got my hands on the original Pokémon Red and Blue, I was captivated. Even before its official release in the UK, I delved into fan translations, eagerly exploring every facet of the game. By the time it reached my peers, I was already an authority on all things Pokémon, thanks to countless playthroughs and an insatiable appetite for knowledge.
My expertise quickly earned me a reputation as the go-to person for all things Pokémon-related, fostering connections and friendships during a time when I felt particularly isolated. Transitioning to a new school without knowing anyone was daunting, but my passion for Pokémon served as a bridge, allowing me to form meaningful relationships with my classmates.
This early experience of being respected for my knowledge laid the foundation for my future endeavours. Driven by a desire to share my passion and expertise with others, I began compiling pixel art and delving into the intricate lore of retro games. While my interests may have evolved over the years, my journey with Pokémon remains a pivotal chapter in my life. Reflecting on my journey, I'm humbled by the impact I've had on others. As a pseudo-educator within the gaming community, I've had the privilege of inspiring individuals to pursue their passions, whether it's through pixel art or game development. Despite struggling with self-esteem and doubts in the past, I'm grateful for the positive feedback and stories of how my work has influenced others.

It's easy to dismiss the significance of something as seemingly trivial as a video game, but for me, Pokémon was more than just a game – it was a catalyst for personal growth and empowerment. As I continue to witness the enduring legacy of Pokémon and the communities it has fostered, I'm reminded of the journey that brought me to where I am today. I am reminded of how my journey through life was intrinsically linked to Pokémon and the world that the team developed, and how I could never have asked for anything more.
Thank you for allowing me to share a glimpse of my story, and as you can see in the attached photos, that young dweeb who simply loved collecting Pokémon never could have imagined the impact his passion would have on others.
