When Pokémon first launched in the UK in 1999, I was about to enter my teens. Like many kids from that era, I was hooked by Pokémania and wanted to get my hands on everything connected to the series. The Trading Card Game (TCG) was something that especially interested me. My friends would give me some of their spare Base and Jungle set cards because I couldn’t convince my parents to buy them for me. By the time the Fossil set was released, I was earning some pocket money each week, so I bought as many booster packs as I could, fully intending to collect all sixty-two cards available in the set. Sadly, I was six cards short of completing Fossil, but nearly twenty years later in 2019, after pulling out my cards from the bottom of the wardrobe and sorting through them, I decided it was time to achieve my long-forgotten goal and purchased the final few cards from eBay. It was certainly a momentous occasion when I placed that final card into the folder and completed my first set of Pokémon cards!
But it didn’t end with the Fossil set. I continued to buy cards through Neo Genesis, Neo Discovery, Neo Revelation, and finally, Neo Destiny in 2002. I can’t recall exactly why I stopped after that set, but I assume it had something to do with the cost of the hobby and my general interest in it declining. I didn’t purchase any brand-new expansions until twenty-one years later, when I decided it would be fun to start collecting again.
In 2023, The Pokémon Company released a trading card set called “Scarlet & Violet—151”, which I had been following since its announcement in Japan earlier that year. At first, I assumed it would be a reprint of the original Base, Jungle, and Fossil sets, with a few extras thrown in. I was surprised to discover that it contained cards with brand-new artwork, which looked beautiful, and made me want to complete the set even more. I was already quite excited by the idea of collecting something focused on the original era of Pokémon, so I took the plunge and committed myself to buying the many products required to give myself the best chance of completing the set.
Scarlet & Violet—151 was released on September 22nd, 2023. One year later, I reflect on what it was like to collect Pokémon cards again.
