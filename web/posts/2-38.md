### Feature: Greg''s Memories of Pokémon TCG East Coast Super Trainer Showdown
Between June 23rd and June 24th, 2001, the Pokémon East Coast Super Trainer Showdown took place at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, New Jersey. This official Pokémon TCG tournament hosted many players across three age divisions. Greg, a player who took part in the 11-14 age group, shares his memories of the event and his experiences with the TCG, including the time he became a Gym Leader!

I was 12 when I attended the 2001 Super Trainer Showdown in Secaucus, New Jersey on Saturday, June 23. My dad brought me to the Meadowlands Exposition Center for the event. He was always supportive of me playing the Pokémon TCG. We frequently visited a local flea market to purchase individual Rare/Holo cards, as it was easier and cheaper long-term than buying random card packs. By this point we were attending Toys R Us weekly for the TCG League events. So to ask my dad to drive us to New Jersey for Pokémon was not difficult.

While I did not intend to rank in the tournament, I nonetheless entered into the main competition to have fun. My deck was primarily Psychic-type driven, with Sabrina’s Alakazam and Gengar, plus Rocket’s and Promo Mewtwo as my main powerhouses. Other cards such as Unown \[M\], Cleffa, and Cool Porygon helped on support, and Murkrow was used as a backup attacker, taking advantage of the massive strength Darkness Energy cards provided at the time. With Sneasel being banned from tournament play, Murkrow was the suitable replacement for the role.

To the best of my recollection I won 2 or 3 matches before I was knocked out of the competition. My final win was a notable one, as it was completed within 3 turns. My opponent was only able to send out 1 Active Pokémon and no Benched Pokémon within that timeframe. On the other hand, I was able to send out Sabrina’s Gastly and evolve it to Sabrina’s Gengar by the 3rd turn. A successful use of Call of the Night (which requires 2 successful coin flips), resulted in my opponent’s Active Pokemon to be returned to their deck, and with no other Pokemon in play, I won by default.

Besides the competition, I had fun with the various activities at the event, including the photo ops with a mascot Pichu, as well as an oversized Sneasel card, with BANNED stamped across it. I also went home with a T-Shirt from the event (which I sadly no longer have), some binder insert pages, and, most prized of all, the Southern Islands Collection, sold early at the event. I had wanted the set since I first saw low quality images of the Japanese cards online years prior. I was pleasantly surprised to see the set for sale, in English, at the event. I still have it today, and keep it in wonderful condition for its age. My deck is also still intact, though the last I had used it, I used proxy cards to keep my better condition ones in my collection binders.

The deck contained the following cards:  

Sabrina’s Alakazam x 2  

Sabrina’s Kadabra x 2  

Sabrina’s Abra Lv. 18 x 2  

Sabrina’s Abra Lv. 12 x 2

My experience with the Pokémon TCG began at the same time as my knowledge of Pokémon itself, after receiving the “Sneak Peak” VHS tape in the mail. Even though the tape said the TCG would be out in November of 1999, I didn’t find it in stores until early \[the\] next year. It didn’t take \[me\] long to get super into the game, buying the Starter Deck, Preconstructed Decks, and some Booster Packs to fill out my collection. The checklist included with the decks made it clear just how many cards there would be.

Not long after, my dad would take me to our local flea market with a dedicated card/toy shop on the second floor. One of the dealers there had table space for playing the game and had individual cards for sale. This made it easier to get cards I needed instead of opening Booster Packs blindly and getting doubles.

As time passed, the expansions came out: Jungle, Fossil, \[plus\] promo cards given out at the movies, Nintendo Power, etc. By early 2000, I heard that there was an official Pokémon League at Toys R Us stores, including promo card giveaways. We had one close to home, so what began then was an almost weekly ritual of going on Saturdays to play. They gave us the books with stamps to receive by playing matches, answering trivia questions, and challenging the “Gym Leaders,” the older and more skilled people that helped run it. Finishing a page in the book to get each of the Badge pins was a huge accomplishment. 

By the next year, 2001, I was offered \[the chance\] to help out and be a Gym Leader. While I wasn’t in charge of the actual behind-the-scenes of the Pokémon League (how stores get the materials from Wizards of the Coast, etc.), I was allowed to help set up/break down the event each week, give out materials, onboard new players, etc. We took two tables and sets of benches from the employee break room, and the boxes of supplies were set up for us. We’d usually set up near the Infants section, as there was enough open floor space for us to put the tables and not be in the way, though we were often so popular we’d have kids playing on the floor nearby.

2001 was the golden year, as we’d have new promo cards to earn every month. They kept it a mystery by sending sticker sheets to put into the back of our Badge Books when the new Promos came out. Sadly, though, by 2002, the fun was over. Whether it was due to Wizards or Toys R Us, I don’t know, but the League was over. No more weekly visits. I found out that the Wizards of the Coast store now hosted the League. I went once, only to find out they charged customers money just to participate. Having everyone in the store and able to buy Booster Packs apparently wasn’t enough for them. I did this once, and the feeling was not the same. No one was warm and welcoming. Having to pay was a disappointment, and I wasn’t allowed to use proxy cards, a common thing at the TRU League. I wasn’t comfortable using my rare cards I only had a single copy of in my deck (except for during the Super Trainer Showdown). I only went to the WotC store for the League once, and that was it. My time as a Pokémon TCG trainer ended in early 2002.

I never forgot the memories made, Badges won, and cards earned. I still have my whole collection, very close to being complete, up through Neo Destiny and all of the Black Star Promo cards.
