### Feature: My Pokémon Collection - Part 3
The Pokémon movies were a huge part of my childhood, and I have some great memories attached to them. This time around, I wanted to focus my collection feature on the original VHS copies of Pokémon I own. There was actually a point where I was considering selling or donating these due to my lack of a VHS player, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.

**Pokémon The First Movie (VHS)**

The first Pokémon movie was one of the very first pieces of Pokémon content I was introduced to by a friend in my class at school. When the movie finally released, I was eager to watch it. The tone was very different from the individual episodes, especially when Mew and Mewtwo accidentally turn Ash into stone and you see the emotion of the Pokémon bring him back to life. I don’t remember the exact circumstances of obtaining the video, but I do remember watching it a few times, and I still have the promo Mewtwo card.

**Pokémon the Movie 2000 (VHS)**

Out of all the movies I am talking about today, Pokémon the Movie 2000 is probably my favourite of them all. I really enjoyed watching this film and I loved the new second generation Pokémon that were introduced. One of the most memorable parts was when Lugia fired an Aeroblast attack at the Pokémon collector Lawrence, who was trying to capture him. It really emphasised the strength of this legendary Pokémon, maybe even more so than Mewtwo’s attacks in the previous movie. This one came with a Pikachu promo card, which is still a part of my collection.

**Pokémon The Movie 3: Spell of the Unown (VHS)**

While not as memorable or enjoyable to me, I vividly remember picking up the third Pokémon movie and watching it at home. I recall pulling our armchair right up to the front of the television and watching it all to myself. Like the previous releases, this one came with a promo Unown J card. It’s one of my favourite promo cards, and I recall taking it out of the box and seeing its striking orange background. I feel very fortunate to have kept all the cards from back then.

**Mewtwo Returns The Movie & The Great Race Double Pack (VHS)**

This double pack contained a sequel to Mewtwo Strikes Back called Mewtwo Returns and a selection of anime episodes that include The Ninja Poké-Showdown, The Flame Pokémon-athon and The Kangaskhan Kid. It was an enjoyable sequel that showed what happened to Mewtwo after the events of the first movie, but it’s sad to see that it hasn’t had any digital releases since. Unfortunately, this release didn’t come with a Pokémon card, but it did come with a sticker sheet!

**Pokémon 4Ever (VHS)**

Pokémon 4Ever was the last Pokémon VHS I purchased, due to DVD’s becoming cheaper and more popular. This was the first movie to be distributed by Miramax, away from 4Kids Entertainment. The yellow cases were gone, and so were the promo Pokémon cards, which was kind of disappointing. Sadly, 4 Ever wasn’t overly memorable for me, but I did enjoy the twist towards the end where we discover who the character of Sam turns out to be!
