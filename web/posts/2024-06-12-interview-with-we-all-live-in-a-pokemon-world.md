### Feature: Interview with We All Live In A Pokémon World
We All Live In A Pokémon World… was a Pokémon fan website that began in the summer of 2000 and was a staunch defender of Pokémon, highlighting rumours and accusations and attempting to dispel them until its closure in November 2016. For this interview, I am delighted to be speaking with its webmistress Kimberly to learn more about her website and her thoughts on some modern-day Pokémon controversies.

#### Thanks for agreeing to speak to us, Kimberly! Can you please introduce yourself and your original website to our readers?
> Kimberly:
> 
> I have been a fan of Pokémon since 1999, at first just wanting to learn more about Pikachu and the other cute characters I’d started to see everywhere, and the more I learned, the more I came to understand their fascinating world which only made me love Pokémon more. I first began We All Live in a Pokémon World... (named for the Orange Islands English opening, which were the most recent episodes of the anime) in 2000 as a means of dispelling the rumors, misconceptions, and controversy that surrounded Pokémon in those early days.
> 
> After the ‘fad’ wore off, I got back into Pokémon toward the end of the Johto era (Master Quest), then even more so during the Diamond & Pearl era, which was my favorite anime series so far, and ended up playing Pokémon Platinum and Pokémon HeartGold well past their max playtime. During that time, I began devoting more time to my Pokémon site, experimenting with new and different designs and keeping up with the issues of the day.
> 
> Learning HTML and web design since 1996, I was perhaps best known for my site Dream Valley: A Collector’s Guide to My Little Pony (1997-2016), which was one of the first online informational guides for the beloved 1980s toys and collectibles. In addition to We All Live in a Pokémon World..., I also created Pokémon fanlistings for Pokémon Ranger (2009-2016), which were my favorite story-based Pokémon games and Ash & Serena (Amourshipping \[2014-2016\]), and adopted and redesigned the Ash/Satoshi fanlisting (2012-2016) after its previous owner retired.

#### It was rather surprising to discover a Pokémon fan website that defended Pokémon! What encouraged you to create the website in the first place?
> Kimberly:
> 
> In the late 1990s/early 2000s, I worked in schools when Pokémon was new and during the height of controversy. Rumors and accusations about Pokémon were going back and forth between teachers, Pokémon cards were being confiscated/banned, and then, no one really seemed to know what to make of Pokémon battles and 150 new characters being introduced all at once.
> 
> The internet was still relatively new and seemed like a good place to start. We All Live in a Pokémon World... began as a single page of my personal homepage as a place where I could express not only my own love for Pokémon, but explain about Pokémon in more detail than just the same rumors and misinformed reports regarding Pokémon battles, while emphasizing the friendship between Pokémon and humans, etc. in a non-confrontational setting. As Pokémon grew, the page was expanded into its own site, with each page devoted to a single topic, where I could further elaborate on the morals and values illustrated by Trainers like Ash, including raising Pokémon with patience and kindness, and protecting Pokémon from harm, citing examples from the Pokémon anime and games to back up my own explanations.
> 
> The site originally had a guestbook, where I received comments from other fans who also wished to support Pokémon and the work I was doing, as well as e-mails, which were also posted on the site for other visitors to read (with the sender’s consent, of course), often sharing their own struggles with those who did not approve of Pokémon. It was my hope to not only reach other fans, but also opponents of Pokémon (parents, teachers, etc.), in hopes to not only dispel those misconceptions about Pokémon, but to know that this was coming from a fellow adult/teacher who could already see past the accusations and negativity, and perhaps take the time to learn what Pokémon was about and understand why it meant so much to their children and to all fans.

#### When it comes to rumours, speculation and misrepresentation, I personally feel that the best way to defend something is with factual information, reputable sources, and other forms of evidence to support the claims. What methods did you undertake to defend Pokémon, its creators, and its products?
> Kimberly:
> 
> I agree, and that’s exactly what I did when I decided to find out what Pokémon was all about. Rather than listening to rumors and the opinions of opponents, I went directly to the source and began watching the Pokémon anime, starting with the first episode in reruns. Immediately, it was the bond between Ash and Pikachu that dismissed any reservations I may have had or heard about battles or catching Pokémon, and from which I quickly discovered the values and life lessons communicated through Pokémon. From the beginning, Ash had to earn Pikachu’s trust and friendship...his struggle and determination to prove to Pikachu that he was worthy of being Pikachu’s partner and friend, which grew into an unbreakable bond that not only extended to Ash’s family of Pokémon, but his desire to befriend and protect all Pokémon, and continued to be the foundation of that world, told time and time again through the various series. 
> 
> He faced off against other Trainers like rival Paul (Diamond & Pearl), \[who\] Ash felt was not raising his Pokémon with the kindness they deserved. He often raised Pokémon abandoned by others (Charmander, Chimchar, etc.) and fought greedy Pokémon hunters attempting to exploit Pokémon for profit, all while following his dream to become a Pokémon Master. Meanwhile, I discovered these same values as I played through the Pokémon video games on journeys of my own. On each page of my site, I included a different quote from the Pokémon episodes, games, or manga to further emphasize those values. This quote recently appeared on the official Pokémon YouTube page with a clip from an episode during Ash’s final journey (“Aim to Be a Pokémon Master”), and if my site was still online today, it would be posted on the main page:
> 
> “I wanna be friends with all of the Pokémon in the world. That’s what it means to be a Pokémon Master.”
> 
> \-Ash, “Aim to Be a Pokémon Master”

#### One example you wrote about passionately on your website was animal rights organisation PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) which have used Pokémon as an example for its campaigns several times throughout the years. In 2011, they campaigned against Nintendo for depicting their Mario character in a Tanooki suit, and even created a parody game around the time of Pokémon Black & White. In your opinion, what do you think is the best way of approaching unjustified and abhorrent campaigns like this?
> Kimberly:
> 
> As noted above, one of the reasons I love Pokémon so much is the relationship between Pokémon and humans, primarily centered around the bond between Trainers and their Pokémon in which Pokémon battle by their side as willing and loyal partners, and Trainers like our hero Ash, who did everything to make sure his Pokémon partners were happy, healthy, and loved. The world of Pokémon was something truly unique, and I had hoped that these values that I understood so easily in which humans and Pokémon could co-exist in a world where they are treated with respect, and in return, lending us their abilities in both work and play... values that have been there from the beginning, even if not so easy for everyone to see then, it seemed that time would have allowed for those early misconceptions to have long become a thing of the past…
> 
> ...Wrong!!
> 
> I remember the day the news broke, deliberately coinciding with the release of Pokémon Black 2 & White 2, sickened by the amount of planning that must have gone into PETA’s vicious and unprovoked assault in their twisted attempt to use the games’ own stories to accuse all Trainers of abusing their Pokémon, already infamous for their gruesome depictions of beloved characters including Ronald McDonald and Mario. Ironically, when I worked in daycare, I was very much opposed to using the outdated nursery rhyme “Bye Baby Bunting”, in which a hunter kills a rabbit and uses its pelt to wrap/clothe his newborn baby, as part of the alternating monthly room décor/curriculum but, unlike PETA, I played Super Mario Bros. 3 back in the day and know the difference between a virtual Tanooki suit/costume and what they automatically assume is a dead raccoon (and probably a dead frog and a dead cat) skin. So, not only was PETA’s attack on Pokémon devastating to me as a fan, but I felt personally betrayed, believing, perhaps in my own innocence (and before I knew about their campaign against Mario), that the message of Pokémon would be obvious to those who claimed to care about animals...
> 
> Meanwhile, I approached PETA’s shortsighted accusations and lies in the same way I had always defended Pokémon by relying on the truth, something PETA obviously did not consider when choosing both their victims and their heroes. And had they bothered to finish the game (both original Black & White and Black 2 & White 2), it would have been clear that Team Plasma’s platform of “Pokémon liberation” was just a front for a criminal organization when leader Ghetsis’ own power-hungry agenda is revealed and Team Plasma are exposed as common Pokémon thieves, admitting to having used Pokémon as “pawns” and “a means to an end”. In the end, no one was cheering for Team Plasma, especially not Pokémon.
> 
> I will never be able to ‘unsee’ the disgusting and brutal images used in PETA’s perverse attempt to turn Pokémon against itself, having struggled to separate my own beliefs from PETA’s two-faced attempt to present an outward image of compassion and ‘ethics’ to an unsuspecting public just looking for cruelty-free shampoo, etc., who may not be aware of the appalling tactics used in underground campaigns such as those against Pokémon, and since 2012, they have done nothing (in the way of an apology or retraction, etc.) to show that their attitude toward Pokémon has changed. Although, how can I expect them to accept a world so different from ours in Pokémon when they can’t even accept our own? After all, these are the same people who also believe we should not have pets. Still, I have to believe that there are reputable animal rescue organizations and individuals fully devoted to saving lives in the real world instead of hiding behind a screen, wasting time and resources campaigning against Pokémon when animals are suffering. Trust is earned; PETA is responsible for their own tarnished reputation; they’re the ones who have something to prove, not Pokémon.

#### There were many pieces of written content across your website, which of them are you most proud of, and why?
> Kimberly:
> 
> During the time I created We All Live in a Pokémon World..., there were countless Pokémon fansites, some even with AAP (anti-anti-Pokémon) sections, but a site devoted entirely to standing up for Pokémon and its message made mine the only one of its kind, not only in the beginning, but throughout the years, adding content in the face of new challenges. I’m not sure I could choose just one or a few pieces I’m most proud of (although I do feel that taking on PETA’s sick travesty was the most crucial). Everything’s important, which is why my site continued to grow, keeping up to date until its final year online...looking back, the overall time and devotion, and ongoing message...I always endeavored to illustrate that Pokémon was about creating a world where all creatures, including humans, could live side-by-side as partners, working together, later expanding into writing more personal pieces, expressing myself as a fan beyond the cause including a Diamond & Pearl tribute, and reviews of favorite games (Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia, Pokémon Conquest).
> 
> Meanwhile, in our world, the message of Pokémon has always been to bring people together, which was the goal of my site from the beginning, spreading that message of friendship and peace, and I have met some of my closest friends through my Pokémon site. And as much as I enjoyed writing and sharing my own experiences with Pokémon, it was never about just taking my word for it, which was why I always encouraged others to watch the episodes and play the games for themselves and get to know the world of Pokémon without the influence of critics ruining it first.

#### In recent years, a number of complaints have been directed towards The Pokémon Company and their partners by fans. For example, when it was announced that not every Pokémon would be returning to Pokémon Sword & Shield (‘Dexit’), the technical issues surrounding Scarlet & Violet, or the issue with Remote Raid Passes that Niantic introduced into Pokémon GO and subsequently nerfed. As a person who ran a project dedicated to defending The Pokémon Company, I am keen to hear your thoughts: Despite the criticism and complaints they receive, do you believe that TPC and the Pokémon brand should always be supported?
> Kimberly:
> 
> Like other fans, there are some decisions the Pokémon Company/TPCi has made that I don’t agree with, for example, as of Scarlet and Violet (as well as some side games, including most recently Pokémon Legends: Arceus), no longer being able to purchase an official (English language) strategy guide or even a Pokédex, and the frustration of having to rely almost entirely on secondhand information from fan sites and the like (there’s your ‘Dexit’!). But more than anything, having lost the Pokémon anime (in the United States) to Netflix (from network/cable TV) was a huge upset and disconnect from the consistency of the characters and stories that my husband and I shared, having always looked forward to watching new episodes on Saturday morning for over twenty years, now just hoping to eventually catch up through purchasing the recent/current episodes on DVD (in addition to the collection of past series we already own). Of course, the changeover from broadcast TV to streaming has affected countless other long-running shows, not just Pokémon (also not the only show we watch that was moved), forcing viewers to make the necessary adjustments, while becoming more and more expensive to follow our favorite series, and can test the loyalty of any fan.
> 
> While I have not personally had experience with some of the issues mentioned above (I always look forward to choosing a new Pokémon team with each new game, and Pokémon GO is one of the few Pokémon games I haven’t played), I am, however, familiar with the issues concerning Scarlet and Violet. A friend of mine who purchased the DLC shortly after its release encountered several of these technical issues in Scarlet, and it admittedly made me skeptical to purchase the DLC for my Violet, finally having decided to wait until well after part two (“The Indigo Disk”) had launched, presumably after all the bugs were worked out, to purchase it. I was fortunate to not have experienced any of the technical flaws so far, having played through both main stories and continuing on with the post story and side quests (BBQs, etc.). On the other hand, I am also a huge fan and longtime player of downloadable Pokémon games such as Pokémon Shuffle and Pokémon Café Mix/Remix, and fortunately haven’t had any issues with either. And when technical problems do occur that affect players, the Pokémon Company has been very good about rewarding all players with useful in-game items to make up for any problems these issues might have caused. Technical issues, of course, don’t just occur in Pokémon games. In nearly every aspect of our lives nowadays, you are unfortunately going to run into some kind of problem with technology that doesn’t work like it’s supposed to.
> 
> As fans, I think that each of us will always have different ideas as to the direction that Pokémon should take, and that some feel that it is our right to criticize because we love Pokémon (or anything) so much. But before we do, I think we have to remind ourselves what it is we love about Pokémon (or anything else) that not only attracted us in the first place, but what keeps us coming back so many years later, and what it ultimately means to us.

#### You first became a fan of Pokémon in 1999, which would have been at the height of Pokémania and when the hype for Pokémon was at its most intense. I am curious to hear how you first got into Pokémon, and learn about your earliest memories of the series!
> Kimberly:
> 
> In 1999, all I really knew about Pokémon was a cute commercial for a Tamagotchi-like virtual Pikachu, during which time, I worked as a substitute teacher, and began hearing rumors and controversy surrounding Pokémon. I also taught in an arts & education center’s summer program, playing vintage video/computer games (Oregon Trail, etc.) on functioning computers from the same era (Apple IIe, IIc, Commodore 64, etc.). We also had some newer computers (Windows 3.1), where kids could draw using the Paint program. In one of the other classes, a student asked his teacher to draw a picture of Vaporeon from his Pokémon card. The teacher admittedly didn’t know anything about Pokémon, but I thought the card was so cute that I began using the computer in my classroom to draw Pokémon for the students, which introduced me to Bulbasaur (I was still so new to Pokémon myself that I wasn’t even sure what the student was saying at first), and I went on to create more Pokémon art (Eevee, Koffing, Squirtle, Charmander, etc.), as students began to ask for more, which I printed out for them to take home, and even showed the students how to draw their favorite Pokémon themselves.
> 
> In every school I worked, students were surprised that a teacher was interested in learning more about Pokémon, instead of just confiscating cards and Game Boys or making judgements based on rumors. They were thrilled to see pictures of Pokémon I had drawn on the blackboard before class (I once drew Ash’s sleeping Charizard; none of the teachers even knew what it was), and sometimes, students would draw their own pictures of Pokémon or Team Rocket and give them to me as gifts to take home. Throughout this time, I had quickly become a fan of Pokémon, watching the anime and following the story of Ash and Pikachu and learning the names of all 150 Pokémon, not only realizing how much I enjoyed it, but not seeing why all of the other teachers did not or where all those rumors and accusations were coming from, which was what led me to create We All Live in a Pokémon World…
#### What are some of the Pokémon items, merchandise or special things that you hold dear from the past, that you would like to share with us?
> Kimberly:
> 
> In the beginning, I didn’t collect too many Pokémon items; my favorites have always been household items, or other things we could use, like a Pikachu whiteboard (2000) on the refrigerator that we’ve always used to write shopping lists, a Pikachu mouse pad that has survived four computers since 1999, and an adorable Pikachu soap dispenser (1999) which has also been in our home since we moved in, and which my husband will often remind me of what a unique item it is and an example of how long Pokémon has been a part of our lives.
> 
> Of course, during this time (Kanto/Johto era), Pokémon was everywhere, including on packages of several new and favorite foods like Eggo waffles (with Gengar or Marrill stamped right on the waffle!), Kraft Macaroni & Cheese (Pokémon shapes, later in Diamond & Pearl), Pop-Tarts, Popsicles, Nutri-Grain Twists, fruit snacks & rolls, and even Pokémon cereal. However, with that always comes controversy for not always being the healthiest foods (but we did have Pokémon vitamins!), which only makes them more desirable. I’ve always known that the first rule of collecting anything is KEEP THE BOX, and we collected them all, which led to a segment on my site, giving these unique, limited-time items their moment and became a part of those memories from back in the day, and later happy to see Pokémon food items returning to stores in recent years, which we enjoyed collecting all over again.
> 
> But perhaps my favorite Pokémon item is a much more recent one, a purse with adorable Eevee/Eevee evolutions art from Hot Topic in 2017 that I carried for more than five years (I only had to stop using it because the material/design was becoming worn from everyday use and didn’t want to cause further damage). During that time, I received so many compliments from people who would just come up to me in stores, etc., telling me how cute it was or that they love Pokémon/Eevee, and it was so nice to know that there are so many Pokémon fans now. And in turn, I now see so many others, of all ages, wearing Pokémon shirts, jackets, etc. or with Pokémon bags or accessories, showing their Pokémon pride and creating a sense of community, which is what Pokémon is all about.

#### Even since its closure in 2016, Pokémon has grown exponentially. At the time of writing, we have nine generations of Pokémon, over 1000 creatures and forms, dozens of Pokémon games, and countless products, animations, and spin-offs. What are your thoughts on Pokémon in the year 2024?
> Kimberly:
> 
> Having been a fan since the beginning, I have always looked forward to what’s next for Pokémon, as well as looking back and reliving memories from years past, and those memories have only grown as each new generation becomes a part of that world that only continues to expand. Visiting the official site, The Pokémon Company focuses appreciatively on the joy that Pokémon brings to so many, and how time has allowed Pokémon to come full circle, and something fans of all ages can enjoy and be proud of. Kids who grew up with Pokémon are now parents and are sharing their love of Pokémon with their own children, playing games or collecting cards together, something they might not have had when they were that age. As I expressed in my final message to visitors to my site, it is Pokémon’s continuing and ever-growing success and popularity, despite any and all obstacles, through the loyalty and support of fans both online and off, that has forever earned Pokémon the respect and honor as some of the most iconic and beloved characters in the world.
> 
> I admit, nowadays it’s not as easy to remember all the names of each new Pokémon, or all the new moves/abilities/forms/evolutions, etc. as it once was, and it can sometimes be overwhelming with so much out there now. But that’s part of what makes Pokémon so fascinating in that there is always something new to look forward to, and there is something for everyone. And despite some setbacks, I can’t imagine Pokémon not being a part of my life.

#### After sixteen years online, We All Live In A Pokémon World… closed its doors in 2016. What was the reason for its closure?
> Kimberly:
> 
> I decided to close all of my sites and fanlistings in November 2016, as changing technology was making it more difficult to maintain them. By then, everything was changing to social media, and the days of fan sites and personal homepages were already long gone. Having worked on websites since 1996 (long before the internet was considered mainstream), I was ready to be ‘just a fan’ of Pokémon, My Little Pony, etc., and have been ‘off the grid’ for the most part ever since. Also, maintaining and keeping current with my sites was practically a full-time job, and closing allowed me time to fully devote to other personal/household/offline projects.

[![Kimberly closed her website in November and left a message to thank her followers for visiting between 2000 and 2016](/web/images/kimberly-closed-her-website-in-november-and-left-a-message-to-thank-her-followers-for-visiting-betwe.jpeg)](/web/images/kimberly-closed-her-website-in-november-and-left-a-message-to-thank-her-followers-for-visiting-betwe.jpeg)*Kimberly closed her website in November and left a message to thank her followers for visiting between 2000 and 2016*

#### We now live in an age of social media, which has allowed for a greater number of voices to share their opinions, and spread rumours and misinformation online. It sounds like we could use a Pokémon website that defends Pokémon again, and debunk rumours and speculation. Would you ever consider reopening the website?
> Kimberly:
> 
> That is definitely a valid point. During the Diamond & Pearl era, I had actually considered closing the site then, feeling that Pokémon’s long-running success meant that there was no longer a need for a site that defends Pokémon like back in those early days, until the era of Black & White, during which I was horribly mistaken. And as stated above, closing the site when I did had nothing to do with my earlier belief that the lies and accusations against Pokémon were a thing of the past. However, after so long offline, I admit I would not know where to start. Again, as stated above, I would not have the time to maintain a website, especially one that requires the amount of time and work as my Pokémon site, or any of my other sites did, in addition to other ongoing projects.
> 
> I can’t speak for other fans, but I do not follow social media, keeping up with Pokémon primarily through official sources (official Pokémon site/YouTube) and reputable news-only Pokémon fan sites. Social media unfortunately adversely affects so many things nowadays, not just Pokémon, and in the end, it’s our responsibility to know the difference and ignore it, as doing otherwise will only continue to enable those who post misinformation, rumors, and ‘fake news’ even further. And though sadly we’re still not there yet, from the beginning, the ultimate goal of We All Live in a Pokémon World... is that we could someday live in a world where a site like mine is no longer necessary.
#### Kimberly, it has been a pleasure speaking to you and learning more about your website and its opinions on Pokémon. Do you have any final words you would like to share with our readers, and visitors of We All Live In A Pokémon World…?
> Kimberly:
> 
> Thank you; I enjoyed doing the interview. In answering the questions, it was nice to read through my site again, reliving good memories, even reading through pages and content I’d forgotten, and well worth all of the time and devotion I put into it for so many years. Of course, looking back, there will always be those difficult times, bad memories, because of the nature of my site...but through it all, it was always about staying positive while focusing on the truth and how much Pokémon meant to me and so many others.
> 
> I would also like to mention that when We All Live in a Pokémon World... closed, the ‘goodbye’ message I posted was online for only a few weeks before the site was completely taken down, and I always felt that it was never enough time to say a proper goodbye. Thanks so much to Johto Times for inviting me to do this interview, where I can also now say a proper thank you to everyone who supported my site and Pokémon over the years, as well as the opportunity to once again express the values of Pokémon and the joy that it has always brought to me, even years after the site closed.

We appreciate Kimberly taking the time to speak to us about her website and the role it played in trying to provide helpful and informative information in support of Pokémon. We wish her the best of luck for the future!
