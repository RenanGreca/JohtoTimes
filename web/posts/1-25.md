### Feature: Event Pokémon Distribution: In-person or online?
Ever since Pokémon Red and Green launched in Japan, event distribution Pokémon have been a way to obtain some rare and exciting creatures. But the way in which those distributions have taken place has changed throughout the years. Many of the early giveaways were conducted in person via a Game Boy and Game Link Cable, a special distribution machine, or by mailing your game cartridge to Nintendo or Game Freak. Some were obtainable at large-scale events hosted by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo, or through toy stores and other retail partners. Since the internet became more accessible, many of these Pokémon have been obtainable online via WiFi events, meaning that players need not even leave their homes in order to obtain one.

When I was younger, I had the good fortune to attend one of the EON Ticket events for Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, in order to obtain a Latias for my copy of Pokémon Ruby. These sorts of distribution events would usually take place in large cities such as London, but I was fortunate that one of the venues chosen was in my hometown. On that day I spoke to lots of other Pokémon fans, received a goodie bag filled with some cool items, and even met a new friend there, one that I continue to speak with to this day. 
In my opinion, in-person distribution events are something very special, and offer a great atmosphere with opportunities to meet new people, obtain cool swag, and have something nice to look back on in the years that follow. It’s also great if you enjoy the bragging rights of owning a Pokémon not many others will have had the chance to receive.
However, I see the benefit of online distributions, especially if you live far away from larger towns and cities where events would usually take place, or are not situated in a country where any kind of distribution takes place at all. Many of the WiFi distributions over the Mystery Gift feature run for a longer period of time, rather than one or two days. I can also acknowledge how convenient it is for those who may miss out due to work, studies, or scheduling conflicts. This is even more vital for those who are not comfortable in crowds, or are not physically able to get to an event due to illness or disability.
Maybe the compromise is to offer everything as hybrid events, where these special Pokémon are initially an in-person event and are then distributed online at a later date for everyone? Those in attendance can claim the event Pokémon in person and can still have all the fun of meeting friends and obtaining merchandise, while those who aren’t able, or choose not to attend, can still receive something later. I feel it would be the fairest way to do it, and it ensures that everyone has an equal opportunity to enjoy themselves.
I want to end this feature on the topic of event distributions for classic games. When Pokémon Crystal was released on the Nintendo 3DS, Celebi’s Japanese-exclusive event was made available to everyone, which I thought was a neat touch. I am hopeful that if more classic mainline titles are released in the future, we will see these time-limited events become a part of the main game, meaning that a new generation will get to experience them.

As I finish typing this opinion piece, I am looking over to my shelf where I still have my Wurmple and Cacnea plastic toys I received in my EON Ticket goodie bag in 2004, and I am reminded once again of that special day. I think I’ll give that friend a call too…
