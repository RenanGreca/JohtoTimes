What was your thoughts of the Detective Pikachu movie?

Hi, Tristan! It’s great to hear from you again, and thank you for your question! Despite being sceptical to begin with, I found Detective Pikachu to be a very enjoyable movie. I enjoyed the story and the connection between Tim and Pikachu (played by Justice Smith and Ryan Reynolds respectively). I am a big fan of Reynolds, so I knew I wouldn’t be disappointed. It proved to me that Pokémon live-action movies can absolutely work, and I hope that we will see a sequel to it in the future. A big shout-out to the credits of the film too, which were a nice throwback to the original Game Boy games. If there are any readers who have yet to see Detective Pikachu, I urge you to do so!
