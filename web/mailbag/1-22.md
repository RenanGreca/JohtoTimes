Hello I wanted to send you my wooden made Pikachu. Since I was tiny I also enjoyed watching Pokémon as I think everyone here does. In art class around the 7th grade here in Germany (around age 12) we had a project to make a wooden figure of something.

I decided to \[do\] Pikachu because I was really into Pokémon at that time. Plus I had a friend then who had the nickname Pichu since she was cute and tiny. Well it was cool to make and it only took like 12 hours in total with the waiting time of drying.

Hi Luca, thank you so much for sending in your wooden Pikachu! This is obviously something very special that you created during your childhood, and I think it’s great that you kept hold of it all these years later. I hope Pokémon has continued to be something you have found enjoyable in the years that have followed.
