[![Poliwag was done for the German Pokémon forum "BisaBoard" as part of a monthly challenge. It's simple and easy to draw. My brother once had a TOMY figurine, which we bought at a flea market together with a bunch of other Pokémon. Unfortunately neither of us has them anymore.](/web/images/poliwag-was-done-for-the-german-pokemon-forum-bisaboard-as-part-of-a-monthly-challenge-its-simple-an.jpeg)](/web/images/poliwag-was-done-for-the-german-pokemon-forum-bisaboard-as-part-of-a-monthly-challenge-its-simple-an.jpeg)*Poliwag was done for the German Pokémon forum "BisaBoard" as part of a monthly challenge.

Corylus, Germany

Corylus! I am happy to see yet another great piece of artwork submitted to the mailbag. Your Poliwag is very cute, and reminds me of its early appearances in the Pokémon TCG in the late 90s and early 2000s. Thank you very much for sharing!
