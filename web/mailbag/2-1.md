[![Hey](/web/images/hey.jpeg)](/web/images/hey.jpeg)*Hey*

I would like to submit these two photos of my Eevee & Oddish planter :) I recently took up gardening and I thought what would make gardening more fun than adding Pokémon to the mix somehow?
I have planted random seeds in both the planters, to get a sort of ‘surprise’ when the plants eventually grow (and maybe bloom?) Please stay tuned for the plant updates :)

Hey Khalid, thank you for sharing your awesome planters with us! I absolutely love them, and it looks like a great activity to focus on throughout 2024! I’m excited to see how well they both develop. Be sure to get back in touch with us in the future with an update on their growth!
