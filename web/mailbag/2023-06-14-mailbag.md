There were a lot of remakes of main Pokemon games \[in the\] last 20 years. There is also a rule (most of the time) where the remake introduces a new gimmick, as the opposite to the official game from the same generation. Like XY and ORAS (Mega Evolution). Sometimes there are totally new features, like HGSS \[with\] walking Pokemon.

If you had a choice of creating one more remake for 3DS or Switch, what would \[be\] your choice, and what gimmick would you introduce to that remake?

Thank you very much, Mateusz. It took me a long time to come up with an answer to your excellent question! At the time of writing, we haven’t seen a Johto-focused game since HeartGold and SoulSilver, so I would create one in the style of Legends: Arceus, with a gimmick that lets you uncover secrets across the ancient land of Johto, by completing stone puzzles similar to what you find in the Ruins of Alph, which would range in complexity. Completing these puzzles would unlock temples and underground locations where you could discover some ancient Johto forms of Pokémon.

I wonder what our readers would suggest? Let us know in the comments below!
