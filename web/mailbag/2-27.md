[![A Cubone fighting off a Dragonair's Wrap is not such a random choice as it might seem at first glance. The illustration is actually a birthday present for a friend of mine and those two \[are among\] her favourite Pokémon. Portraying a fierce battle was a dynamic way \[to\] put them together. Particularly, the Carddass cards from 1997 were a big inspiration for the composition, as we rarely see Pokémon battling each other in official illustrations. For the colouration I used some new, high quality water colours. They are strong, so strong in fact they covered up the line art and I had \[to\] brighten it up with some clear water. Nonetheless the present was still received well.](/web/images/a-cubone-fighting-off-a-dragonairs-wrap-is-not-such-a-random-choice-as-it-might-seem-at-first-glance.jpeg)](/web/images/a-cubone-fighting-off-a-dragonairs-wrap-is-not-such-a-random-choice-as-it-might-seem-at-first-glance.jpeg)*A Cubone fighting off a Dragonair's Wrap is not such a random choice as it might seem at first glance.
