A couple of issues ago, Affie got in touch with an awesome pumpkin that was carved back in 2019. I was delighted to see their 2023 carving in our mailbag this week!

Hello! Here is the photograph for this year's pumpkin carving, Litwick! It took some time to get it all carved but I'm really pleased with how it turned out.

It’s great to hear from you again, Affie! I love your pumpkin carving for 2023, and I thank you for sending it over to us. Litwick is a great Pokémon, and you did a fantastic job with the design. Keep up the good work, and I truly hope we get to see more of your creativity and passion in the future!
