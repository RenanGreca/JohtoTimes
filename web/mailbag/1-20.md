What are your thoughts about the sandwich mechanic in Scarlet/Violet? I think it's fun to make sandwiches, and it's so neat to see your Pokémon enjoy them too, I even think it heals them!!

Thank you very much for your question, Torvus! I was never a huge fan of these kinds of gimmicks in Pokémon, but when I was playing my initial play through of Scarlet, and making sandwiches online with friends, I made hilariously bad ones. Fillings would roll off, the bread on the top of the sandwich would slip and fall onto the table, and result in a pretty embarrassing looking sandwich. But we loved it, and it became a bit of a joke in the subsequent times we played together.
I also managed to catch a shiny Gastly thanks to the increased odds a sandwich gave me, which I caught in the final few seconds before the ability wore off. The Gastly was given to one of our mutual friends who loves Gengar, which I hope he appreciated!
