I feel \[that\] normal type \[Pokémon\] can be overlooked, and I've wanted to build myself an ultimate normal roster, so I want to know what normal-types you'd include in a team?

It’s great to hear from you once again, Rosie! I don’t think I could justify an entire team of normal type Pokémon, but Snorlax immediately comes to mind, and I hear that Ursaluna is incredibly powerful, so that would definitely be a contender! I would likely utilise some dual-types and items that boost the effectiveness of normal type moves where possible.
