Volkner was one of my fave Gym Leaders and the Luxray lines are some of my favorite Pokemon
Poké Trainer Theo, Philippines
Hello once again, Theo! Thank you for sharing your awesome artwork of Volkner! I love the two sleeping Pokémon, especially the Pachirisu which I’m sure is having some pleasant dreams about berries. Overall, I find this to be a very cute piece of art. Keep up the great work!
