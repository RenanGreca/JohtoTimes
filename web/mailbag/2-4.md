Thanks for contacting us, Iceflame44! This is a high-quality piece of digital art. The winter theme makes me want to grab a big mug of hot chocolate to warm myself up! I appreciate the detail in the lighting on Meowstic and swirling snowflakes that are being whipped up by an icy wind. Keep up the great work!  
As for your question, I would choose a Rowlet as a pet because it’s adorable and round, and if it was similar to Ash’s Rowlet from the Pokémon anime it would have a fun personality that would keep me entertained and make me smile when I was having a bad day! My second answer would be a Groudon, but I think it might be a little difficult to tame…
