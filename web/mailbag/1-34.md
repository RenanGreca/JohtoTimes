Tristan, it’s always a pleasure to hear from you; thanks once again for your question! I would say the Pokémon video game that surprised me the most was Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. Up until 2020 when I first played it, I had no idea that a Pokémon game could have such a fantastic story, filled with emotion and characters that I actually cared about. It opened up a whole new chapter for the Pokémon series, and now I am eagerly anticipating future Mystery Dungeon games.
