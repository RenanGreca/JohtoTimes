Here is my Spiritomb Pumpkin from 2019, I carved it myself at home and I really loved it. 

Affie Lockhart, Manchester UK

Hey Affie! Thank you for sending this awesome photo to us; I absolutely love your carving! You really chose a great Pokémon for this design. I wonder if you’ll be making another this year? I hope you’ll consider sending more of your creations our way, so we can share them here with our Johto Times readers!
