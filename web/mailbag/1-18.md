If you were to be a gym leader, what type(s) would you be, and why? \[Also.\] what would your team be? Would you have just six, or a larger roster to swap in and out?

Thank you very much for your question, Rosie! I had to think about this one a little, and I narrowed it down to two options. 
When I was a kid, I was a huge fan of Lance and his Pokémon, despite only Dragonair and Dragonite being actual dragon-type Pokémon at the time. A gym of Dragon types would be cool now that there’s much more variety, but I would be a lot nicer than Clair at the Blackthorn City gym. In terms of a team, I choose Dragonite, Kingdra, Druddigon, Alolan Form Exeggutor, Dragapult, and Appletun.
While not a type, I also like the idea of raising Pokémon that came from Fossils. I think that a gym focused around archaeology and resurrection of prehistoric Pokémon could be a really awesome idea. For this team, I would choose Kabutops, Aerodactyl, Carracosta, Archeops, Tyrantrum and Dracovish.
