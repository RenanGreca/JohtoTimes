Hello again. Tristan here.
A question popped into my head recently: How do you feel about Pokémon from earlier generations having different forms in recent generations?  
Thanks 
Tristan S, North Carolina

Hello again Tristan, great to hear from you, and thanks very much for your great question! When regional forms of classic Pokémon were introduced during the seventh generation of Pokémon games, I immediately fell in love with Alolan Marowak due to how awesome it looked, and I found Alolan Exeggutor and Dugtrio hilarious! Since then, there have been many variants released, and I welcome all the new and creative approaches introduced by The Pokémon Company!
