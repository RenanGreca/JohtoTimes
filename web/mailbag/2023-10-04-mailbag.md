Back when Pokemon had its big 25th anniversary a few years ago it reignited my love to collect the cards. Yeah, I still had no idea how to play the game, but I had a huge binder at my parents’ house filled with cards I had collected. I even had some Japanese cards I got from some cousins back in the day. It isn't the biggest collection but one I am most proud of. I actually remember my very first card. An Onix. I got it for my birthday from a cousin of mine and it was before I actually knew what Pokémon was. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. As I collected more I never knew how to play the actual game so I would play "War" with them. Whoever had a higher HP won. 

Fast forward to now. I know how to play the game and still love collecting the cards. I have even gotten my kids their own cards and when they are a bit older I plan to teach them how to play. I honestly don't even care about the value of the cards. I love every single one I own as many of them have memories attached to them. Especially Onix.

Thank you for your letter, Richard! It’s always great to hear about people’s Pokémon collections, and early era Pokémon trading cards are something I am deeply fond of. Thanks for the photo you sent across! Did you know that you actually own a shadowless Onix? One of the ways you can tell is by the thickness of the text used for the HP, so you have something a little more rare than a usual Onix card, and something even more special than you may have realised! I hope that you have continued to hold on to your collection and have taken the opportunity to share your memories of Pokémon with your children.

Your comment about having a “war” with your Pokémon reminded me of something that happened to me many years ago in my neighbourhood. I took my holo Charizard to my friend’s house, and outside his front door there was a neighbourhood kid who said he could beat my Charizard with his Weedle from the base set. He claimed that by using its Poison Sting attack, he could poison Charizard for ten damage, and repeat it over and over until it died, which would allow him to claim it for himself. Naturally, I laughed at the idea and ignored his request, but I admired his attempt at humour!
