Hi Johto Times,

In the previous issue, you showed off some boxes of Bandai Pokémon model kits. I was surprised, that was a kind of merchandise I didn't know existed.

I decided to buy a kit of Lugia, one of my favourite legendary pokemon. Putting it together was very simple and straightforward, requiring no extra tools. The instructions were in Japanese, but that wasn't really an issue. There were four sprue sheets, each labeled A1 A2 B1 B2. Each part on the sheet had a separate standalone number. The instructions would first refer to the sheet, then to the part number with pictures of what you should do.

I've included a photo of the finished model and I'm very happy with the result. It's highly adjustable, not flimsy at all, and I think they did a great job designing it. I only wish that they made a model of Shadow Lugia from Gale of Darkness too!

Thanks for your message, LuckyStoat! I really enjoyed the photographs that SteC shared in the previous issue and thought the model kits were really cool. I love your Lugia; it seems like a cool thing to display on a shelf among other gaming items. Not only that, but I think these models would be great to put together if you’re trying to relax and want to take a break from a computer screen for a few hours. Maybe I’ll pick one up for myself at some point!
