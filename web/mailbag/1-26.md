Hello, I wanted to share this photo of my second tattoo, which the eagle-eyed readers can see is of Umbreon.
Of the many creatures I could encounter in my first game, Pokémon Silver, I was immediately taken by the Moonlight Pokémon and endeavoured to make it part of my team. I have since travelled across many regions with Pokémon #197 on my team.
Once I took the leap and got my first tattoo (Lyrics to my favourite song, Smells Like Teen Spirit), I was trying to think of what could be the next thing to ink onto my body. As soon as the idea of Umbreon entered my head, it remained in there for this tattoo represents more than just my favourite Pokémon across the 9 regions. It also encapsulates my love for a franchise which has been a massive part of my life since childhood, and was key to the long-lasting friendships I've held with my best friends since secondary school.
Cheers
James Rodrigues, United Kingdom
Thanks so much for getting in touch with us, James! Your Umbreon tattoo is AWESOME! You speak so passionately of Pokémon, and it’s clear that the franchise is very dear to you. I am extremely happy to hear that you have some great friendships that have withstood the test of time, long may they continue! I am confident that you and Umbreon will have many great adventures with Pokémon in the years to come.
