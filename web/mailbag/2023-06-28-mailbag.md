I really like Nessa in terms of her design when she was first introduced as a Gym Leader which is why I was inspired to make artworks of her. I actually have a really hard time with the pose I gave her and have to look up a lot of references just to get it right. I’m not really the type of person who really does background that well but I at least did the best that I can with it.

Thank you for sharing your fanart with us, Theo! Nessa was a very popular character from the Pokémon Sword & Shield games, so we understand why you would want to draw her. We think you did a fantastic job, and hope that you keep up the great work!
