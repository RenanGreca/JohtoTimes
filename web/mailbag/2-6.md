I saw that you're taking more mail so figured I'd submit more art. Here's the Squirtle evolution line.
Josh Sobek, United States
It’s great to hear from you again, Josh! Previously you shared the [Charmander](https://johto.substack.com/p/vol2-2) and [Bulbasaur](https://johto.substack.com/p/vol1-41) lines, so I was pleased to see that you drew the Squirtle line too! As I have continued to say to you, keep up the excellent work!
