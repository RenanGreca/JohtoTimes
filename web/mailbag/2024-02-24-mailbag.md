Hey SteC, it's great to hear from you! I have so many Pokémon items that I have collected throughout the years of being a fan, from trading cards, Tazos, figures, stickers and even video game soundtracks! Currently, I am trying to complete a set of Pokémon Sliders, which were figures released in the late 90s and early 2000s. They had a metal ball inside the base that would allow the Pokémon to roll across flat surfaces, and crash into targets and other Pokémon Sliders. I only learned about them last year, but they look so charming that I decided I would try and collect them all! Currently, I have ten Pokémon Sliders, and I think I'm about halfway done!
