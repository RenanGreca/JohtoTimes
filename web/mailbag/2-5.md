As a follow up to Vol. 1, Issue 32 - Memories of the Pokemon League Summer Trainer Tour 99, where you published my memories about attending a Mall Tour stop for Pokémon, I was able to get into that floppy disk and get the picture of myself at 14 years old in 1999.

The picture shows off the giant Pikachu card as well as my especially cool style at the time (wearing a freebie Pokémon shirt I received from my first encounter with Pokémon: the Pikachu VW Beetle at the Cincinnati Zoo following the "Cheetah Run 5K" the previous August, and a Blastoise dog tag!).

One thing to note that I had forgotten about is that there were multiple booths set up to take pictures quickly, you can see another person lined up in the next booth also having their picture taken at the same time!

Thanks for sending over this email, Jim! I am really glad you were able to obtain this photograph from the floppy disk! It’s amazing to think that data has been on there for a quarter of a century and is still intact. I’ve added it to the feature, [which can be viewed here](https://johto.substack.com/p/memories-pokemon-league-summer-trainer-tour-99) for any readers who have yet to see it for themselves.

I should disclose here that since we featured his submission, Jim kindly accepted an offer to help edit the newsletter (beginning in January 2024), which has been a big help. We have another feature from him, written in advance, that we hope to share in the near future!
