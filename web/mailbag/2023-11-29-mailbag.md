Given how far the Pokémon games have come from the beginning, where do you predict the series will go? Will we see new regions and Pokémon, or is there a possible remake? Or do you predict something different?

Thank you for your questions Tristan, it’s great to include a familiar face in our final mailbag of the year! Let me begin by responding to your first question by saying that I believe the Pokémon series will continue to grow for decades to come. It has continued to have a significant presence across many forms of entertainment in so many different countries, and at the time of writing it shows no signs of slowing down.

To answer your questions on whether we will see new regions and Pokémon, I believe that’s inevitable. So far the mainline games have been themed on locations within Japan, Europe and the United States. There are still so many places in the real world that the franchise hasn’t touched upon, so I am sure they have plenty of options to turn to.

Finally on remakes, it is my belief that we will see a return to Unova within the next five years, likely on the Nintendo Switch successor console. Whether that will be a remake of Black & White, or a sequel in the form of Black & White 3, or a Pokemon Legends: Kyurem game, is unknown. It’s possible we may get something entirely different, and that’s exciting to think about! There’s also the possibility we could return to Johto, which would be my personal preference, providing that a quality game is created and has plenty of development time.
