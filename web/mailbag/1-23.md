If you could have a Pokémon with you in the real world, what Pokémon would that be?

Thank you so much for your great question, Tristan! This was a pretty simple one to answer, because it’s Rowlet, my favourite Pokémon of all! I would love to have the cute little grass owl along with me on my walks in the countryside, and eating food with me at a picnic. I would let it read my Pokémon Adventures manga, and it would keep me company during the evenings while I write this newsletter.

When I was very young, I would dream of Pokémon being real, and spending time with them. I know that was a dream many young kids shared back then, but ultimately we return to reality and accept that it’s probably a good thing that Pokémon are not real. Can you imagine the devastation legendary Pokémon would cause? In Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, we saw how much destruction the likes of Groudon and Kyogre could manage, almost bringing an end to the entire world! So I think I’m quite content with Pokémon being left in the world of fiction.
