Hi Johto Times readers, my name is Jay from Australia. For Paldea Evolved I have collaborated with several online stores in order to collect data on box hits – which has been summarised in this infographic. My goal for this process has been to try and create a community of data sharing such that we can collect a large enough sample size for valid statistical analysis of set ratios, as well as correct some of the incorrect perceptions of probability that get posted. As boxes are not completely randomised, your probabilities are slightly better for finding specific cards compared to just opening loose boosters (hypergeometric vs binomial for those mathematically inclined).

Jay, Australia

It’s very nice to hear from you Jay, thank you for sharing your work with Johto Times! I was quite impressed to see such a professional looking infographic showing the results of box openings. It has been some time since I purchased trading cards; the last time was Neo Destiny in 2002. I hope this information will prove useful to anyone who is interested in purchasing cards from the Paldea Evolved set!
