\[Do you have\] any favourite underrated/overlooked Pokémon? Any Pokémon you'd give a bit of a 'stat makeover' to?

Rosie Kenworthy, United Kingdom

It’s always a pleasure to answer your questions, Rosie! In terms of underrated and overlooked Pokémon, I need to say in advance that I am not a competitive Pokémon player, so it may be obvious why this Pokémon is overlooked in competitive play. However, I was always a fan of Jumpluff back in Pokémon Crystal, because I would use Sleep Powder, Leech Seed, and Giga Drain to put my friend in a difficult position. This can also apply to a stat makeover, because it has poor stats across the board. As a third stage evolution, Jumpluff needs all the help it can get!
