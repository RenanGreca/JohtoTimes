Hi Josh, and thanks for getting in touch again to share your art with us! I enjoyed your Bulbasaur evolution line artwork from [Volume 1, Issue 41](https://johto.substack.com/p/vol1-41), and it’s great to see that you had even more art throughout the years to share with us! Keep up the great work, and continue doing what you love!
