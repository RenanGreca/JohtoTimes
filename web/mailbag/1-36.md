TrainerCes, United Kingdom
Thank you for your question, TrainerCes! I love that you were able to carry your Dragonite all the way from your Pokémon FireRed journey! I have done the same with quite a number of my Pokémon from as far back as Pokémon Ruby and other Game Boy Advance titles. I actually shared one of these in [last week’s feature](https://johto.substack.com/p/memories-of-my-shiny-pokemon-encounters), where I gave mention to my first ever shiny capture: Zigzagoon (now Linoone). I also have a Latios that I’ve taken through many battles and contests and has quite a few ribbons!
Thank you also for sharing a link to your Ribbon Quest! I hope you have a lot of success with it!
