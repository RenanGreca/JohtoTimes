Josh Sobek, United States
It’s great to hear from you again, Josh! Thank you for sharing your artwork of Absol, or should I say, two Absol? I love the autumnal leaves you used for the Absol to lay on, and it reminds me of a lot of artwork you would see in the early era of the Pokémon TCG, so if you were going for that, you nailed it, in my opinion! As always, keep up the fantastic work!
