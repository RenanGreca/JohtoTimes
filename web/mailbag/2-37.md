[![\[Charizard is\] probably the most drawn Pokémon by me and many others. It's just such an excellent design with its simplicity. Despite that, it took me some sketches to figure out a pose I was happy with. While it might be a bit basic with its feet on the ground and spreading its wings, I think it looks interesting enough. After scanning it I have to admit there's a resemblance with the sprite from the Red and Blue version, or is it just me? Either way it shows how much of an impact those games had on me.](/web/images/charizard-is-probably-the-most-drawn-pokemon-by-me-and-many-others-its-just-such-an-excellent-design.jpeg)](/web/images/charizard-is-probably-the-most-drawn-pokemon-by-me-and-many-others-its-just-such-an-excellent-design.jpeg)*\[Charizard is\] probably the most drawn Pokémon by me and many others.

Corylus, Germany

Hello Corylus, and thank you once again for another great piece of art! Charizard is a favourite of many fans, myself included. Your watercolour artworks continue to impress me, and I am thankful that you decided to share it with us! I think my favourite part of this piece is the wings; you got the shape just right, and they look great! As always, keep up the great work.
