Foolhardy the Nidoking (as worn by Icarus) will be out to share rare candies & full sized bars with trick-or-treaters on Halloween eve. A hand-sewn Nidoking hoodie and hand-made mask complete the look.

Icarus, United States

Thanks very much for sharing your awesome photographs with us, Icarus! I have to be honest; I don’t believe I have ever seen a Nidoking costume before, and it looks fantastic! I wonder how many of the people trick-or-treating will know which character you are? It was also great to see how big of a Mewtwo fan you were. I appreciate you sharing the link to your [Mewtwo Museum](http://www.demon-sushi.com/mewtwo/) with me, and I hope people will go and check it out!
